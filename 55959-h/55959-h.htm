<h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>The true American is happy in the thought that
his country is a great and glorious one. He can
say with his heart as well as his lips, "This is the
land of the Free and the home of the Brave."</p>

<p>Those who journey far from their native land
and find themselves in foreign countries tell us how
they are stirred and thrilled when by any chance
the stars and stripes of the American flag meet their
view. These stars and stripes stand for the struggles
for freedom, the brave deeds in the cause of right
and justice, the heroism of those who have laid down
their lives that their country should still live, and
the brother-love that binds together all the men,
women, and children who can say, "I am an
American!"</p>

<p>It is only right that the boys and girls of America,
as soon as they are able to understand, should hear
the stories of those who took the first steps toward
the building of this nation&mdash;those who risked life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
and fortune and who were willing to face unknown
dangers for the sake of freedom.</p>

<p>If these boys and girls of America are to grow up
with the earnest desire of keeping the sacred trust
that must descend to them; if they are to keep this
country the land of the free and the home of the
brave; if their aspirations and ideals shall be of the
highest and the purest, so that the powers and
privileges of America shall increase rather than
diminish with the coming years, then let the plant
of patriotism take root early in their hearts that it
may grow with their growth and blossom in perfect
fullness with their maturer years.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="small">THE NORSEMEN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">His</span> name wasn't Sam and he wasn't their real
uncle, but everybody else called him Uncle
Sam, so Joe and Lucy followed their example.</p>

<p>He was tall and thin and had a sharp face. A
funny little tuft of hair grew on his chin and when
he was thinking deeply he was fond of stroking
this tuft with his big bony hand.</p>

<p>His clothes always seemed to be old-fashioned.
When the neighbors were speaking of him they
would sometimes say, "How much he looks like the
newspaper pictures of 'Uncle Sam.'"</p>

<p>"Whenever I meet him, he somehow makes me
think of America," said Joe's father. "I never
knew anyone who loved his country as dearly as
he does. He is perfectly happy whenever he can
get anyone to listen to stories of our great men
and the things that happened here long ago."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<p>It was for these reasons that people began calling
him Uncle Sam before Joe and Lucy were born.</p>

<p>His real name was Ebenezer Wilkins, but the
children had to stop and think before they could
remember it. He lived in a cosy little cottage at
the end of the village and kept house there all alone
from one year's end to another.</p>

<p>Everybody loved him. His kind blue eyes looked
tenderly upon each child in the place. If measles
or chicken-pox shut a boy or girl away from playmates,
Uncle Sam was sure to hear of it. Then,
when his day's work was done and he had eaten
his supper of bread and milk, he would visit the
sick child and make him forget his troubles as he
told stories of boys and girls who lived in the early
days of the white people in America.</p>

<p>Joe and Lucy were twins. Somehow or other
Uncle Sam had grown to love them more than any
other children in the country round. When they
were babies he used to dandle them on his knees.
He taught them to take their first steps alone. He
bought a book of "Mother Goose's Melodies" on
purpose to learn the rhymes and afterwards repeat
them to the listening babies.</p>

<p>Sometimes he even stayed home from church on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Sunday mornings so as to take care of these twins
and give their father and mother a chance to go
away together.</p>

<p>"Twins are a great care, a great care," he would
say slowly. But he would add with a twinkle in
his eyes, "They are never too much of a care for
Uncle Sam."</p>

<p>"He is better than any <i>real</i> uncle in the world,"
said Joe, as he and Lucy opened the gate leading
into the old man's garden.</p>

<p>It was a summer evening and the sun was just
setting. The rows of hollyhocks and marigolds
looked prettier than ever in the sunset light.</p>

<p>"Uncle Sam loves bright things," said Lucy, looking
at the flowers. "He is always finding something
new to admire. That is why I like to walk
in the woods with him."</p>

<p>"He shows me many things I should never see
myself," answered Joe.</p>

<p>By this time the children had reached the door
of the house, and stepped inside. They never
stopped to knock; Uncle Sam would not have
liked it.</p>

<p>"I've brought you some cookies, Uncle Sam,"
said Lucy, handing a covered dish to the old man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
"Mother made them this morning. She put raisins
in them because she knew you are fond of fruit
cookies."</p>

<p>Uncle Sam was pleased when he lifted the napkin
and looked at his present.</p>

<p>"I can make bread and cook meat and potatoes,
but cake is beyond my skill. It takes women-folks
to do such work." The old man laughed softly
as he put the cookies away in the cupboard.</p>

<p>"It is a lovely evening. Won't you come out on
the porch and tell us stories in the twilight?"</p>

<p>As Lucy spoke, she reached up and put her arms
around Uncle Sam's neck. He was so tall he had
to bend down to let her do so.</p>

<p>"I suppose you want me to tell you about Cinderella
for the fiftieth time, or maybe you would
rather hear about Aladdin and his Wonderful
Lamp?"</p>

<p>"No, Uncle Sam," said Joe before Lucy had a
chance to answer. "We are getting too big for
fairy stories. We have just begun to study geography
at school. We like it better than anything
we've ever had. So Lucy and I have been talking
it over. We said we would ask you to tell us true
stories now about America, and the Indians, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
brave white people who first dared to come here,
you know, and all such things."</p>

<p>Uncle Sam fairly beamed with delight.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking of that very thing, children.
I have been longing for the time when you would
like to hear some of the history of this glorious
country. You will like it, too. Why, it is better
than any fairy stories that ever were told."</p>

<p>In five minutes more the old man was sitting in
his big easy chair on the porch. Lucy was perched
on one of the broad arms of the chair, and Joe on
the other.</p>

<p>"We are all ready, so please begin," said Lucy,
coaxingly.</p>

<p>"Very well. Shut your eyes for a minute so
you cannot look at those rows of hollyhocks in
front of you. I want you to see a different picture.
You must take a peep at this country of ours before
a white man ever set foot on it."</p>

<p>"All right; I am ready, for my eyes are shut
tight," cried Joe with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Now, then. First you must notice the great
forests that stretch over a large part of the land.
Wild beasts are roaming about in the darkness of
those woods. Wolves and foxes, bears and wildcats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
live a free and happy life, for the sound of a
gun has never yet been heard.</p>

<p>"Turn your thoughts next to the great plains of
the west. Thousands of buffaloes are wandering
about. The herds are so vast that in some places
the earth is fairly black with them.</p>

<p>"Here and there, over the country, stand the villages
of the Red Men. They are usually built near
the shores of streams or ponds so that fresh water
may be plentiful.</p>

<p>"There are no stores, no factories, no churches,
no roads, from one shore of America to the other.</p>

<p>"At first, it may seem strange to you that the Indians
made no roads, for they were traveling a good
deal of the time. They moved their homes whenever
the game became scarce where they happened
to be living. Besides that, they delighted in war
and one tribe was continually taking some other
one by surprise.</p>

<p>"They did not, however, go about in the way
white people do. They journeyed on foot in single
file and the narrow paths they trod through the
forests can be seen to this day. Some of those paths
are hundreds of years old. They are many miles
in length. Such paths are called trails.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>"I have traveled over one of the Indian trails. It
was in the state of New York. It made me feel
queer as I thought of the painted Red Men who so
long ago made that path through the dark woods.</p>

<p>"The clothing and houses of these people were
quite different in the different parts of this country.
The games and festivals of one tribe were often unlike
those of any other.</p>

<p>"Some Indians lived in tents covered with the
skins of wild animals. Others had houses of birch
bark. Then again, there were tribes who braided
grasses into pretty mats with which they covered
the framework of their houses.</p>

<p>"The food was also different. In the south,
where the air is warm and pleasant almost all the
year, the Red Men ate a great deal of fruit. Up
here in the north they lived largely on the corn that
the women planted and tended, while out on the
great plains they ate quantities of buffalo meat."</p>

<p>Lucy's eyes opened wider and wider as the old
man talked.</p>

<p>"I didn't need to close them at all," she said.
"I can always see the pictures you paint with words.
You make them so bright, Uncle Sam."</p>

<p>"Some other time, my dear, we will talk more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
about the Red Children, but now we will turn to
the first white men who visited America.</p>

<p>"The first visitors from Europe were bold Norsemen.
Their homes were in the far north. There
were many deep, narrow bays along the shores of
their own country and they loved the ocean from
the time they were born. While they were still
children, they learned to sail over its rough waves,
and by the time they were young men they were
quite fearless. The worst storms and the fiercest
winds did not make them tremble.</p>

<p>"From year to year they kept sailing farther and
farther westward in their queer boats."</p>

<p>"Why were they queer, Uncle Sam?" asked Lucy.</p>

<p>"They would seem queer to us because they had
such high prows and sterns and because large figures
of dragons and other strange creatures were often
carved on the ends of the boats. The sails, too,
were of a different shape from any you ever saw.</p>

<p>"But let me go on with my story. It happened
one time that some Vikings, as these brave Norse
seamen were called, sailed so far into the west that
they came to an island they had never seen before.
This was Iceland. You have heard the name,
haven't you, children?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Sam."</p>

<p>"Iceland lies about half-way between Europe and
America, but it is much farther north than we are.
The Norsemen who came upon it by accident, called
it Snowland."</p>

<p>"I think that is a pretty name. I wish it were
called Snowland, now," said Lucy, half to herself.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a pretty name," said Uncle Sam.
Then he went on.</p>

<p>"The one who first saw Iceland did not remain
there. He went back to Norway. Four years
later, another Norseman was driven to the coast of
Iceland by a storm. Before he left it, he sailed all
around its shores and found it was an island.</p>

<p>"When he got home again, he said it was such
a pleasant place that another daring Viking decided
to go to Iceland to live. He carried seeds for planting
and cattle to furnish milk and meat. He stayed
there all one winter. It was so cold that the poor
cattle died.</p>

<p>"When spring came, the Norseman made ready
to plant his seeds, but the land was still covered
with ice. 'This is not a fit place for anyone to live,'
he cried. He once more packed his goods on his
ship and sailed for Norway.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>"That, however, was not the end of the white
men's life in Iceland. Ten years after that another
band of Norsemen went there and settled. They
lived in peace and comfort. Children were born
and grew up in that cold island of the north. They
were carefully taught by their parents and became
wise men and women. This settlement in Iceland
lasted for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>"You children may wonder why I tell you so
much about the Norsemen coming to Iceland, but
it is like the first step of a ladder. Perhaps you are
getting tired, though, and do not wish to hear any
more to-night."</p>

<p>"O no, we are not a bit tired, Uncle Sam," said
both Lucy and her brother.</p>

<p>"Well, then, if Iceland was the first step toward
America, Greenland was the second one.</p>

<p>"Some of the early settlers in Iceland were driven
westward in a storm while they were out sailing.
It was then that they first saw the rocky shores of
Greenland.</p>

<p>"A good many years after this there was a certain
man living in Iceland named Eric the Red.
He did not get along very well with his neighbors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
and had many quarrels with them. He said to himself:</p>

<p>"'I will seek that land west of us and will make
a home for myself there.'</p>

<p>"He sailed away from Iceland and was not heard
of again for three years. When he came back on
a visit, he spoke of the place where he had been
living as 'Greenland.' He thought:</p>

<p>"'If I give it a good name, others will like to go
there and settle.'"</p>

<p>"Now I know why it was called Greenland," said
Lucy, laughing. "Whenever we sing 'From Greenland's
Icy Mountains,' I always wonder about the
name. I knew it must be a cold and icy land, because
of the words of the hymn."</p>

<p>"Yes, that was the way of it. The name Greenland
sounded very pleasant to the people of Iceland
and a large company of them went back with Eric
to settle among the icy mountains you sing about.</p>

<p>"We come now to the third accident and the
third step that brought the Norsemen to our own
land.</p>

<p>"Eric the Red had sons. They were bold and
daring sailors, like their father. During the long
winter evenings they used to listen to the stories of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
the older people. There was one that they liked
best of all. It was the tale of a young man named
Biarne who was trying to find the way from Iceland
to Greenland. His father had gone there with
Eric, and Biarne wished to follow him.</p>

<p>"He started off in the right direction. When he
had sailed out of sight of land, a thick fog settled
down. Then a north wind began to blow. Day
after day, the ship was driven by the strong north
wind. Biarne could do nothing but wonder, 'Where
are we going? Surely, this wind will never carry
us to Greenland.'</p>

<p>"At last the fog cleared away and not long after
that the Norseman and his crew found they were
sailing near a shore on which trees were growing.
Low hills rose behind it. It could not be Greenland,
truly, for Biarne had been told that the hills
there were high and that they were covered with ice.</p>

<p>"When Biarne refused to land, his men were quite
angry. 'I must go on with my search for my
father,' he told them. 'I only care now to find him.'</p>

<p>"Again they set sail and after two more days
they saw land again. It was low and wooded, so
Biarne knew that this could not be the country he
was seeking.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p>"'I will not stop here,' he told his men. Of
course they grumbled, but they were obliged to do
as he wished.</p>

<p>"Three more days passed, and a land with high
and snowy mountains came into sight.</p>

<p>"'I am sure this is not Greenland, either,' said
Biarne, and he would not stop. He sailed along its
shores, however, long enough to find it was an
island.</p>

<p>"In three days from that time, he reached the
shores of Greenland. When Biarne at last cast
anchor he was very near that part of the country
where his father was living.</p>

<p>"Whenever Eric's sons heard this story of Biarne,
they thought, 'When we grow up, we will go to sea.
Then we will try to find the country with green
hills and many trees. Who knows what else we
shall see in such a pleasant land?"</p>

<p>"The time came at last when the eldest son of
Eric was old enough to start on a long voyage. It
was in the year 1000. Biarne went with him.</p>

<p>"The first shore that met their eyes was Newfoundland.
They landed and found it was a plain
covered with stones. They returned to the ships
and soon Nova Scotia came in sight.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p>"After they had looked over that land, they
started once more and sailed southward. They
came to our own New England. I believe they
were not a hundred miles away from where we are
this very minute.</p>

<p>"They were much pleased with the place. They
found plenty of large salmon in the waters. Trees
grew everywhere about them. The air was much
warmer and pleasanter than in Greenland.</p>

<p>"There was one thing which delighted them more
than anything else. They found vines with great
bunches of grapes growing upon them. This is
how it happened. One night one of their party was
missing. He had gone with a few men to look
around and see what they could discover. This
man was a German and his name was Tyrker. His
friends came back without him. He had wandered
away from them. They believed he was lost.</p>

<p>"Everyone felt bad. They thought they should
never see him again. Some of them went to hunt
for the missing man. They had not gone far when
they met him. He seemed wild with joy. He
could hardly speak, he was so glad. At first, his
friends thought he had lost his mind.</p>

<p>"After a while he was able to say that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
found vines with grapes upon them. He knew
what they were, for he had seen grapes growing in
his own country of Germany.</p>

<p>"It seemed too good to be true. They all knew
that the wine they liked so well was made from
grapes. They followed Tyrker and found the vines
he had described.</p>

<p>"What a treasure they had discovered! Stores
of grapes were gathered day after day and carried
on board the ship. Trees were also cut down, for
the people in Greenland would be glad to have all
the lumber their friends could bring them.</p>

<p>"The Vikings said, 'We will call this place Vinland
because of the grape vines we have found.'</p>

<p>"As soon as the ship had been loaded with all it
could carry, the joyful party left our shores and
turned northward once more. During their short
visit here they saw no other people.</p>

<p>"When they reached home they told such bright
stories of their visit that others wished to go to
Vinland.</p>

<p>"Another party of Norsemen soon started. When
they got here, they met some people who must have
been Eskimos. These savages were quite short and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
had broad faces. They had skin boats such as the
Eskimos use to this day."</p>

<p>"I never heard of Eskimos around here!" said
Joe in surprise.</p>

<p>"I don't know how to explain it except in this
way," replied Uncle Sam. "In those days the
Eskimos, or some of them, must have lived along
these shores, for the Norsemen certainly found them
here. The Indians may have driven them away
afterwards. We can only guess about it.</p>

<p>"The last Norsemen who came here did not stay
long. Many things happened to prevent it. I will
tell you of one of these, because it is really funny.</p>

<p>"A bull which the Norsemen had brought among
their cattle rushed out of the woods one day. It
frightened some Eskimos who had come to trade
with the white men. They managed to reach their
boats and paddled away as fast as they could go.
They thought the bull was some dreadful creature
the Norsemen would use against them in war.</p>

<p>"They went away, as I said, but they returned
with great numbers of their own people. The Vikings
said that they were now like a rushing torrent.
They came to fight and to drive the white men from
their shores.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>"It would have been a sad day for the Norsemen
if it had not been for one brave woman. They were
fleeing from the Eskimos when she rushed out and
faced the savages. She did not try to attack them,
but began to strike at herself with a sword. They
were so startled that they turned and fled to their
boats.</p>

<p>"This was only one of the many adventures the
Vikings had in Vinland. They had so many
troubles that after a few years they made up their
minds to remain in Greenland."</p>

<p>"How do you know all these things are true,
Uncle Sam? Did the Norse people write books
about them?"</p>

<p>"Those are good questions, Joe. The Norsemen
did not write any history of themselves at that time.
They did not know how to write. They were great
story-tellers, however, and during the long winter
evenings they used to tell, over and over again, the
things that had happened to them. They made
songs about their adventures. Their children
learned these songs and when they grew up they
taught them to their children. Hundreds of years
afterwards Roman priests came among them and
told them of the Christian God. At the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
the priests taught them to read and write. They
now began to write down the history of their people.</p>

<p>"But, dear me, children, I have been so busy talking
I never thought how late it is growing. There
is your father at the gate. He must be coming for
you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Uncle Sam," said Lucy, as she
kissed the old man good-night, "I enjoyed what you
told us ever so much."</p>

<p>"I am glad you started with the Norsemen," said
Joe. "I always like to hear the first part of anything.
So, of course, as you are going to tell us
the story of America, we ought to know the very
beginning of it."</p>

<p>"My dear boy," said Uncle Sam, "no one knows
the real beginning. All I could do was to start with
the coming of the white men to this country."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="small">THE GENOESE SAILOR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">"Here</span> we are, Uncle Sam. We came early
so there would be time for a good long
story."</p>

<p>The old man sat reading his newspaper in the soft
light of the setting sun. He looked up with a pleasant
smile to greet the twins as they came arm in arm
down the path.</p>

<p>"So you did not get too tired last night, Joe?"
he replied. "I didn't know but that you would beg
me to go back to fairy stories and leave true ones
till you get older."</p>

<p>"Fairy stories indeed!" exclaimed the boy with a
look of scorn. "Lucy and I both want to hear about
real people. Don't we Lucy?"</p>

<p>"Of course; we said so last night, and we think
so more than ever now. Have you made up your
mind what to tell us next, Uncle Sam? But perhaps
you want to finish your newspaper."</p>

<p>"Newspapers can wait till little folk are asleep in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
their beds, my darlings. Besides, I have a story all
ready and waiting. It is knocking at the door of
my mind this very moment and saying, 'Please let
me out, please let me out.' So out it must come.
There, Joe, stretch yourself comfortably in that
hammock; and Lucy, take the steamer chair and
draw it up close by my side. Now I hope you are
both ready for a visit to another part of the world.</p>

<p>"We won't take any trunks, and there will be no
sea-sickness, nor trouble of any kind. So let us
start at once on a voyage across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>"Whew! Here we are safe and sound on the
shores of Italy. The waves are rolling gently and
the air is sweet and pleasant.</p>

<p>"A dark-skinned boy is sitting on the edge of the
wharf and looking out to sea. He is watching the
ships coming into port. He can see a tiny speck
in the distance but he knows it is the top of some
mast. As he watches it a sail comes into view under
it. It comes nearer and nearer until the whole of a
ship can be seen.</p>

<p>"The name of the boy who sat looking out to sea
was Christopher Columbus.</p>

<p>"He loved the sea better than anything else. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
longed to live on it and make long voyages. He
did not know what it was to be afraid.</p>

<p>"As he grew up, he read all he could about the
earth. He found that some wise men believed it
was not flat, as many supposed, but was round.
They also thought it much smaller than it really is.</p>

<p>"The young Columbus said to himself: 'If the
world is really round, we can reach India by sailing
west, instead of making such a long and tiresome
journey to the east."</p>

<p>"Why did he care so much about getting to India?"
asked Lucy.</p>

<p>"The people of Europe thought India was the
richest land in the world. It had great stores of
gold and silver. Beautiful silks and satins, wonderful
pearls and emeralds, fragrant spices,&mdash;all these
things were brought from that glorious land. It
is no wonder that Columbus, as well as everyone
else, was interested in such a rich country.</p>

<p>"There was another reason, however, why Columbus
thought so much about India and wished to
find a shorter way of reaching it. He loved the
Lord with all his heart. He had been told that the
people of the East were heathens and that they worshiped
idols.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>"He thought: 'I would like to tell these people of
the One God and of Jesus, the Friend of all men.'</p>

<p>"I believe he cared more about that than for the
silks and spices.</p>

<p>"As soon as Columbus was old enough, he went
to sea with some of his relations. He learned how
to steer a ship and how to manage it in storms.
He proved himself brave and daring in sea-fights.
He studied the winds and tides.</p>

<p>"The time came at last when he spoke to the people
of his own town in Italy. He told them he believed
he could find India by sailing to the west.
They did not listen to him. He himself could not fit
up ships to make a long voyage, for he had no
money. So he could not try his experiment.</p>

<p>"Years passed by and Columbus went to Portugal.
He still had one great desire in his heart. You
know what that was.</p>

<p>"He lost no time in speaking to the King of Portugal.
The king listened to the plan. He thought
it was a wise one. But he did not offer to send
Columbus on a voyage of discovery. O, no! He
preferred to send some of his own sailors. If the
plan succeeded, he thought he would gain more by
so doing.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>"He sent the Italian away. Then he took the
maps and charts Columbus had made and showed
them to the wisest men of the country. He thought:
'I will make use of what Columbus knows, but he
shall get no reward.'</p>

<p>"He was not honest. That is what I think.
Don't you agree with me?"</p>

<p>"Of course we do," both children exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Some ships were fitted out and sailed into the
west. They had not gone far, however, before the
sailors became afraid and turned back. The king
of Portugal did not try again."</p>

<p>"I am glad he didn't," said Lucy.</p>

<p>"It served him right," cried Joe.</p>

<p>"We must not leave Columbus," Uncle Sam went
on. "The brave sailor left Portugal, but he was
not discouraged. He kept thinking, thinking where
he should try next. After a while, he thought of
Spain. He knew that country was eager for wealth
and new lands. He would go there. He started for
the Spanish court. His little son went with him.</p>

<p>"The journey through the country was very tiresome.
They went slowly, for the roads were rough.
The little boy sat in front of his father on the horse's
back.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>

<p>"At last, one evening, they stopped to rest at a
convent. Columbus told the good monks of the
plan that was so dear to him. He showed them his
charts of the world.</p>

<p>"They were much interested. They said: 'Our
king and queen must see your charts. We believe
they will give you the money to fit out the ships
that you need. It will be a great thing for our
country if you find a short way to India.'</p>

<p>"Columbus felt happy when he heard the monks'
words. He left his little son in their care and went
on his way to the court of Ferdinand and Isabella.</p>

<p>"The king and queen listened kindly, but they
could see no way of giving money to Columbus. A
war was going on at this very time and they needed
all their money to carry it on.</p>

<p>"Columbus stayed in Spain for seven long years.
He tried to get some of the rich men of the country
to listen to his plans and furnish money. It was
all in vain.</p>

<p>"At last, just as he was leaving the country, some
messengers came to him. They said: 'Queen
Isabella wishes to talk with you once more. She
would like to help you.'</p>

<p>"How gladly Columbus turned back! He found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
the queen had such faith in him that she was even
willing to sell her beautiful jewels, if necessary, for
the sake of giving him money.</p>

<p>"He set to work at once to get a fleet ready.
Three ships were chosen. Their bows and sterns
were built high up out of the water. They were
very different from the ships of to-day. Provisions
to last a whole year were stowed away in them.</p>

<p>"It was not as easy to find sailors as it was to get
the ships."</p>

<p>"I don't see why," interrupted Joe. "I should
think there would have been plenty of men eager
to go."</p>

<p>"Not so, my lad," replied Uncle Sam. "Only
the boldest men would dare to sail far into the west
at that time. The people of those days were full of
queer fancies. They thought they would come to
enchanted islands and great dragons and all sorts of
fearful things if they went far away from home.</p>

<p>"At last, however, enough sailors promised to
go and the great day came for the ships to set sail.
How excited everyone was! Would these men ever
come back to the shores of Spain? Would they
really find India, or was it only the dream of a very
bold man?</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>"The wharves were covered with people who had
gathered to see the ships start on their daring
voyage.</p>

<p>"They sailed farther and farther into the west;
now the lower parts could be but dimly seen; then
only the tops of the masts; then they faded altogether
from sight.</p>

<p>"Now let us leave the onlookers of the shores
and join the brave Columbus on the deck of the
Santa Maria, his flag-ship.</p>

<p>"Day after day he guided the ships onward and
ever westward. After they had passed the Canary
Islands, the men were always on the watch for signs
of some new land. After days, and then weeks, on
the great ocean the sailors became afraid. They
begged their leader to turn back, but they begged
in vain. He would not listen.</p>

<p>"At first he tried to keep up their courage by
telling them of the riches they would gain, or the
honors their church would give them if they carried
the teachings of Christ to the heathens. When such
words lost their power Columbus became stern. He
told the men how angry the king would be if they
did not obey their captain.</p>

    <span class="small">COLUMBUS AND HIS FLAG-SHIP</span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>"The time came when they began to plot against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Columbus. They said: 'We will destroy him.
Then, when we get home, we will say that he fell
overboard.'</p>

<p>"Could they ever reach home, now they were so
far away? The men became afraid of what might
happen to them if Columbus were dead and no one
left to pilot them home again. So they did not
kill him.</p>

<p>"He knew they did not feel kindly to him and
he thought it would be best to make some bargain
with them. So he said: 'If we do not see land in a
certain number of days I will promise to turn back
toward Spain.'</p>

<p>"How eagerly he now watched from the deck
of his vessel! It seemed as though his hopes and
beliefs would not prove true. The last day came,&mdash;the
day on which he had promised to turn back if
they found no signs of land.</p>

<p>"Lo! a stick carved by some person's hand came
floating along by the ship's side. This was not all,
for a branch with berries on it was picked up out of
the water. Land must be near!</p>

<p>"'I will give a large reward to the man who first
sees it,' cried Columbus. As he watched that very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
night he saw a light in the distance. It moved. He
called two of his men to look at it.</p>

<p>"Their hearts leaped for joy at the sight.</p>

<p>"Before morning came, a sailor saw the shore
in the distance by the light of the moon.</p>

<p>"Children," said Uncle Sam solemnly, "never forget
that it was the 12th of October of the year 1492
that Columbus first stepped upon the shores of the
New World. He was dressed in a full suit of steel
armor and he held the royal banner of Spain as he
landed on the island which he named San Salvador.</p>

<p>"He planted the cross of the Christians and, with
his officers and men around him, knelt down to thank
God for His great goodness in bringing them so far
in safety.</p>

<p>"'How beautiful, how beautiful!' Columbus exclaimed
as he looked about him. Tall palm trees
were moving gently in the warm breeze; strange and
lovely flowers were growing all around; birds of
bright colors flew overhead.</p>

<p>"But these were not the only things to fill the
brave sailor with wonder. He and his men were
soon surrounded by strange-looking people. They
had straight black hair and dark red skins. They
wore little or no clothing.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>"'This is India, without a doubt,' said Columbus,
'and these people are Indians.'</p>

<p>"He noticed the gold ornaments in their ears and
he thought with delight of the treasures he would
carry back to Spain to good Queen Isabella.</p>

<p>"The Red Men were as much surprised as the
Spaniards. They whispered to each other, 'These
white beings must be gods come from the heavens
to visit us.'</p>

<p>"Then they pointed to the ships and said, 'The
great birds that have brought them to us are now
floating on the water.'</p>

<p>"The Indians wished to show honor to their visitors.
They hurried to their simple homes and gathered
grains and fruits. They brought them as
presents to the Spaniards.</p>

<p>"The white men were glad to receive the corn,
cotton, and fruits. They feasted on the delicious
cocoanuts and bananas, yet they were not satisfied.
Gold was what they most wanted. When they asked
the Indians where to find it, the savages pointed
towards the south."</p>

<p>"I am glad Columbus wasn't a Spaniard," said
Joe, who had kept still a long time for a lively boy.
"I just hate the Spaniards. I believe all they care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
for is riches. It's a good thing we beat them in
the last war."</p>

<p>"My dear child," replied Uncle Sam, "You should
hate no one. We may thank the Spaniards for one
thing at least. If it had not been for them, Columbus
might never have been able to cross the ocean
and discover America. You must remember they
gave him the ships and money he needed."</p>

<p>"It was the good Queen Isabella," said Joe, "and
she didn't seem at all like the rest of her people.
But please excuse me for interrupting you, Uncle
Sam."</p>

<p>"That is all right, Joe. It shows you are a good
listener. Now we will go back to Columbus resting
among the palm trees.</p>

<p>"I am sure you children would have loved him.
He had bright, keen eyes, yet they were kind and
loving; and he moved about with the air of a king."</p>

<p>"He had the right to do so," said Lucy, thoughtfully.
"He couldn't help feeling how great he
was."</p>

<p>"You are quite right," answered Uncle Sam, as
he patted the little girl's head. "Even the steps of
a brave man must be different from those of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
coward. The bravery gets into them without the
man's thinking about it.</p>

<p>"But dear me! It is getting late, and I am only
half through my story. We have turned our backs
on Columbus and left him alone with the Red Men
quite as long as is polite. He enjoyed himself very
much with them, however, and stayed several days
on the island.</p>

<p>"Then he took to his ships once more and sailed
about among the different islands which he called
the Indies. He thought that the right name for
them, as he still believed he was near the mainland
of India.</p>

<p>"Each time they landed, his men kept asking the
natives where gold could be found. Each time they
were disappointed. But Columbus thought it must
be near at hand. He never dreamed that he was
still far from the land of spices and precious stones.</p>

<p>"At the end of twelve weeks he said, 'We ought
to go back to Spain and tell what we have discovered.'</p>

<p>"He gathered stores of the strange fruits and
grains and rich woods and packed them safely away
in the ships. He also took some of the brightly-feathered
birds.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>"He left a part of the sailors on one of the islands.
They were to make a settlement. Then they would
have a home ready for Columbus when he should
come again with more of their people.</p>

<p>"When he had chosen some of the Indians to go
back with him, all was ready and he began to cross
the great ocean once more."</p>

<p>"He must have been almost bursting with pride
and joy," cried Joe. "And the voyage home must
have seemed long, because he had so much to tell."</p>

<p>"It came to an end at last, although there were
terrible storms and the ships came very near being
wrecked," Uncle Sam went on. "At length, however,
they reached Spain.</p>

<p>"The news of their return spread quickly. As
soon as Columbus landed crowds gathered to hear
about his voyage and the whole country was filled
with joy.</p>

<p>"When Columbus went to court to tell his story
to the king and queen they would not let him stand
before them. 'He is too great a man,' they thought.
'He has gained the right to sit in our presence.'"</p>

<p>"O, my!" said Joe, "I thought everybody had to
stand before kings and queens."</p>

<p>"Columbus wasn't a king, but he was certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
as great, only in another way. Ferdinand was quite
right in thinking so. He and his good wife listened
with delight to the story of the greatest voyage any
man ever made.</p>

<p>"They believed as Columbus did that a short way
to India had been found. They eagerly examined
the curious things brought to them from the west.
They ate of the delicious fruits and admired the
bright birds and beautiful woods.</p>

<p>"They said: 'We will have a grand procession
through the streets of our city. Columbus shall
wear beautiful garments and shall ride in the midst.'</p>

<p>"The Indians, bright with paint and feathers,
went first of all in the procession. Crowds of people
lined the streets to see the Red Men, the curious
fruits and flowers, the parrots, and the stuffed bodies
of animals they had never heard of before.</p>

<p>"They wished, most of all, to look upon the great
man who had dared to sail so far into the west and
who had brought India with all its riches to Spain.
For everyone believed this was what Columbus had
done.</p>

<p>"Many entertainments were prepared for the
great sailor. Nearly everyone wished to give him
honor. A few, however, were jealous.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<p>"One day while Columbus was at a dinner party
given in his honor one of the king's courtiers said:</p>

<p>"'It was not a hard thing to do what this Italian
has done. Anyone else might have done the same
thing.'</p>

<p>"Of course the man said this because he was
jealous and did not like to see so much attention
given to a poor sailor from Italy.</p>

<p>"Columbus did not seem troubled at this man's
words. He took an egg from the table and handed
it to the speaker. Then he said:</p>

<p>"'Can you make that egg stand on end?'</p>

<p>"The man tried, but could not do it. It was
passed from one person to another. Everyone
failed. At last it came back to Columbus. He took
it in his hand and struck it gently on the table so
that the shell was slightly cracked. Then, taking
away his hand, he left it standing on end.</p>

<p>"'It is easy enough for anyone to do that,' cried
the courtier.</p>

<p>"'It is also easy for anyone to find the Indies
after I have shown the way,' was the reply of
Columbus.</p>

<p>"Not long after this the great man made ready for
another voyage across the ocean.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>"How different everything was now! There was
no trouble now to find sailors willing to go with
him. Indeed, it was almost too easy. Everyone
was anxious to visit the Indies. They believed it
was the quickest way to gain riches and comfort.</p>

<p>"When the second fleet was ready to sail there
were seventeen ships and fifteen hundred men. Only
think of it! It was almost like a traveling city.</p>

<p>"They had no trouble in crossing the ocean, but
when they came to the island where Columbus had
before left a part of his men, there was no sign of
them nor of the homes they had made.</p>

<p>"'This time I will choose a different place to
settle,' said Columbus.</p>

<p>"He sailed into a fine harbor about forty miles
away. The men landed and began to build the first
city of the New World for white people to live in.
They called it Isabella after the good queen of Spain.</p>

<p>"Columbus spent some time as governor of the
settlement. Then he went back to Spain with news
of the white men's city in the west. He did not
stay long, however. He was soon restless for a
third voyage across the great ocean.</p>

<p>"He sailed farther to the southward than he had
before. For the first time he saw the shores of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
South America. Then he went back to the settlement
in the West Indies, but the people were not
glad to see him."</p>

<p>Uncle Sam stopped for a moment and looked
quite sad.</p>

<p>"Children," he said, "I must tell the truth and say
that Columbus was not as good a governor as he
was a sailor. It would have been hard work for
anyone to rule his people, for they had to work
hard and they were not satisfied because gold was
not plentiful.</p>

<p>"'It is not what we expected,' they cried angrily.
'We thought you would bring us to a land filled
with gold and diamonds.'</p>

<p>"Some of them even whispered among themselves,
'Columbus is not what he pretends to be. He
has cheated us badly.'</p>

<p>"At last they declared they would not let him stay
there any longer. They put chains upon him and
sent him back to Spain."</p>

<p>Uncle Sam took a picture from the table drawer.</p>

<p>"Look at Columbus now," said the old man.
"There he sits on the deck of the ship with heavy
chains bound on his arms like one who has done a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
great wrong. Yet he gave a whole continent to the
people who put them on him.</p>

<p>"'I will take off your chains,' said the kind-hearted
captain of the ship. It is a shame for you
to wear them.'</p>

<p>"'No, no. Let them remain,' answered Columbus.
I will wear them as a token of the kindness
of princes.'</p>

<p>"How different was his third landing in Spain!
This time there were no crowds waiting to show him
honor. He was carried before the queen, who wept
in pity at the sight of her old friend in chains. The
brave man now broke down. As he tried to tell his
story his words were choked with sobs.</p>

<p>"Isabella did not desert him, however. She
helped him to fit out another fleet and he started on
his last voyage. He sailed among other islands of
the West Indies and returned to Spain after a great
deal of suffering. He was sick and poor. There
were many who once could not do too much for him
but who now mocked him.</p>

<p>"He died with the belief that he had found a short
way to India. He had no thought of what he had
really discovered. It is a shame he did not get the
honor he deserved."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<p>Uncle Sam rose suddenly from his arm chair and
began to walk up and down the room. "Yes, it is
a shame. A burning shame. Children, let us sing
'Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean.'"</p>

<p>The old man turned to the little organ at one side
of the room. In a moment the house was filled with
the voices of Uncle Sam and his two young friends.
When the song was over, the children kissed him
good-night and started for home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="small">JOHN CABOT AND THE CODFISH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">That</span> same night after the children had gone
to bed Lucy was just falling asleep when Joe
called out:</p>

<p>"I say, Lucy, I wonder why our country isn't
always called Columbia instead of America."</p>

<p>"Do keep still, Joe. I was so nice and sleepy and
now you have waked me up," answered his sister.
"You can ask Uncle Sam the next time you see
him."</p>

<p>Two or three evenings afterward the old man
was on his knees weeding his pansy bed when he
heard steps near by.</p>

<p>"Uncle Sam! Uncle Sam! where are you?" called
a girl's voice.</p>

<p>"Here I am, my little pink of a Lucy," and he
straightened himself up by the side of the apple tree
around which the pansies were growing.</p>

<p>"That is a lovely place for them. They don't
have too much sunshine. How large the blossoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
are! May I have that big purple one? It looks at
me like a loving face."</p>

<p>"Of course you may, Lucy. But where is Joe?"</p>

<p>"He has gone on an errand for mother. After
that, he's coming here. But we can't stay very long
this evening. Mother said we must go to bed early
to-night so as to be fresh for the picnic to-morrow.
You are going, aren't you, Uncle Sam?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I am. I wouldn't miss it for the
world."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad. Mother said I must be sure to tell
you not to take any lunch. We shall carry enough
for you. It is a lovely lunch. Roast chicken and
nut cake and apple jelly. I can hardly wait for to-morrow.
Now aren't you glad you are going?"</p>

<p>"It makes me hungry to think of it, so you and I
will have to eat some cherries I picked this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Aren't they beauties! How juicy they are. Red
cherries are prettier, but I think I like these blackhearts
the best. Here comes Joe now."</p>

<p>"You are just in time," called Uncle Sam, as Joe
came hurrying along.</p>

<p>"Cherries are ripe, cherries are ripe," sang Lucy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
as her brother sat down on the steps, quite out of
breath.</p>

<p>"Christopher!" exclaimed Joe as soon as he could
speak. "I've had an awful long walk and I'm as
tired as anything."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't say 'Christopher,' nor 'awful,'
either, Joe. They are as bad as slang."</p>

<p>"You needn't preach, Lucy. I should like to
know a better word than 'Christopher' in the whole
language. Wasn't Columbus's name Christopher?"</p>

<p>"I know that. It is all the more reason for not
making the word so common. He was too great
a man. But, Uncle Sam, that makes me think of
what Joe was saying the other night. He and I
both think Columbia is a better name for our country
than America."</p>

<p>"Let us see about that, children. I must tell you
how it all happened.</p>

<p>"You remember, of course, that Columbus never
knew what he had discovered. He thought he had
visited the shores of Asia. Some years after his
first great voyage another man from his own country
of Italy sailed out into the west. His name was
Americus Vespucius. A little hard to say, isn't it?</p>

<p>"He was a merchant who had made several long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
voyages already. He went farther south than Columbus
and sailed along the shores of South
America.</p>

<p>"'It is a vast country,' he said to himself, and
he was the first one to call it the 'New World.' He
wrote long letters telling of what he had seen. The
man who printed these letters called the New World
America in his honor. And it has been called
America ever since. But I like Columbia best myself,
children. The name is very dear to me."</p>

<p>While Joe and Lucy finished eating the cherries,
Uncle Sam sat thinking.</p>

<p>"What shall I next tell them about our glorious
land?" he said to himself. "Oh, now I know. I
am sure they would like to hear about John Cabot
and the codfish. It isn't a very long story and there
is just time enough before they should go home."</p>

<p>The twins were quite willing to listen. They had
already found that true stories were quite as interesting
as make-believe ones.</p>

<p>As they sat on the steps in the twilight this is
what they heard:</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a little boy who lived
in Italy. It was about the time that Columbus lived
there, too. The boy's name was John Cabot. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
loved the sea as Columbus did. He liked to listen
to stories of strange lands.</p>

<p>When he grew up he was not satisfied to stay at
home. He began to travel and made longer and
longer journeys. After a while he went to England
and made his home in that country. He did not stay
there, however, for he wished to learn all he could
about the world.</p>

<p>On one of his journeys he traveled to Arabia.
He met some men there who were leading camels
loaded with spices. People used a great deal of
spice in their food and drink, so it was very precious
to them.</p>

<p>John Cabot began to talk with the men. He
asked them where they got all those spices. They
pointed still farther to the east and explained to
him that it was a long, long way off.</p>

<p>He thought a good deal about what the men told
him. He said to himself:</p>

<p>"If I should go west far enough I should surely
come to the east. The wise men must be right when
they tell us the earth is round."</p>

<p>After he went back to England he heard the great
news from Spain. A man named Columbus had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
done just what Cabot thought possible. He had
reached the east by sailing west.</p>

<p>"It is truly wonderful," said the people. It was
the talk of the whole country. John Cabot was as
much excited as everyone else. He asked the king
of England to send him on a voyage to the newly-found
country. The king thought:</p>

<p>"The Spaniards should not be the only ones to
bring back the riches of India. We must have a
share of their good fortune."</p>

<p>He was quite willing, therefore, to send John
Cabot, who was a wise man and a good sailor.
Cabot's son went with him on the voyage.</p>

<p>They came to the mainland of North America,
but they were much farther north than Columbus
had ever been. It was quite cold and the place
looked bare and lonesome.</p>

<p>They saw no Indians, but there were some fishnets
lying about near the shore. These nets being
there showed that probably people were not far
away.</p>

<p>"What great numbers of fish there are in these
waters," exclaimed Cabot. "I never in my life before
saw so many. 'The Land of the Codfish' is
a good name for this country."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>He did not stay long, for food was becoming
scarce. So the ship soon started on the homeward
voyage. When they reached England the sailors
told wonderful stories about the "Land of the Codfish."
They said:</p>

<p>"The waters were so thick with fish that the ship
sometimes could not move as fast as it otherwise
would. One thing amused us very much. It was
the strange sight of bears fishing! The great
creatures swam out into the water and caught the
fish in their paws. Sometimes the fish were so large
that they fought hard to get away, but the bears
nearly always won the battle."</p>

<p>John Cabot told the king he had discovered the
country of China. He was treated with the highest
honor and called "The Great Admiral." He was
dressed in rich silks. The king promised he should
have a sum of money given him every year for the
rest of his life.</p>

<p>After a while the king began to say to himself:</p>

<p>"It is all very well to make a voyage to the west
and find the east, but that is not enough. I should
like some of the gold and gems and delicious spices
found there."</p>

<p>So it came about that John Cabot and his son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
started out on a second voyage. When they reached
North America this time they sailed along its shores
for a long distance. They saw Indians dressed in
skins and wearing ornaments of copper. But they
found no gold nor spices.</p>

<p>Cabot still thought he had visited Asia. The king
of England did not care about him any longer, however.
He was of no use if he could not bring to
England the treasures of India. This is probably
the reason we know nothing more about John Cabot.</p>

<p>We do not even know how long he lived nor when
he died. His son Sebastian lived to be a bright and
lively old man and was always glad to hear of the
voyages of others to far-away places.</p>

<p>When Uncle Sam had finished the story of John
Cabot he told the children why he wished them to
remember it.</p>

<p>"Columbus made his voyages with the help of
Spain," said he. "That country claimed the right
to hold the lands he discovered. That is why the
people who settled in the West Indies and in almost
all of South America came from Spain and spoke
the Spanish language.</p>

<p>"But John Cabot sailed for the English king and
that is why the English said:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>"'We claim the eastern part of North America.'</p>

<p>"Years after the time of John Cabot they sent
people to settle here. They spoke our language and
planted English ways and English thoughts with
their corn and potatoes."</p>

<p>Uncle Sam laughed as he added, "Maybe you and
I would have been Spaniards if it had not been for
John Cabot. I wonder how you would have liked
that, Joe. I know you are not too fond of your
Spanish cousins."</p>

<p>"Cousins! Ugh! I don't like to think of their
being relations of mine."</p>

<p>"My dear boy, this world isn't so very large after
all, and one great Father loves us and cares for all.
Of course, we think America could teach Spain one
or two things, but I don't doubt she could help us
in some ways, too. No one is perfect, Joe, or else
we shouldn't need to live in this world. Come,
children, give me a kiss and run off to your little
beds."</p>

<p>"Good-night, sleep tight, and don't let the mosquitos
bite," Lucy called to her old friend as she
followed Joe down the path.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">A</span> finer day could not have been chosen for
the picnic. When the party started for the
pine grove four miles from home there were six
carriages full of people. It was a lovely place for
a picnic party and Joe and Lucy played hard all day
with their little friends. Six o'clock came all too
soon.</p>

<p>"Please stay a little longer and eat the rest of our
lunch for supper," begged the children. The older
people were quite willing.</p>

<p>"It is a good thing we can get plenty of good
water from that spring," said Lucy's father. "It
is nearly as cold as ice water and certainly as cold as
anyone ever ought to drink. I should like to come
here every day for the sake of a drink of it."</p>

<p>"I love to hear the water as it makes its way
down over the rocks. They say the spring never
dries up, even in the hottest days of summer," said
Uncle Sam, who was standing near.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<p>"Uncle Sam! A story, a story!" cried some one,
as they settled themselves on the grass to eat chicken
sandwiches and apple turnovers.</p>

<p>"That spring makes me think of something you
might like to hear. It is true, though it is nearly
as strange as a fairy story. I suppose the older
ones all know it."</p>

<p>"Do tell it, Uncle Sam," cried the children, and
their parents seemed as willing to listen as the little
ones.</p>

<p>As the evening clouds changed from silver to
gold and crimson, and the young moon peeped
shyly out in the evening sky, Uncle Sam told the
story of</p>


<p class="center in0 p2t p1b">THE FOUNTAIN OF EVERLASTING YOUTH</p>

<p>A long time ago there was a young knight in
Spain named Ponce de Leon. He was gay and
handsome, fond of dress and of good times. Columbus
had made his voyages to America and come back
to Spain to die.</p>

<p>The men whom he had left in the West Indies
needed a governor. The king looked around his
court. At last he chose Ponce de Leon as the best
man to send to the New World. The knight was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
quite willing, so he went to live in the island of
Porto Rico, one of the West Indies.</p>

<p>His life was an easy one. He did very little himself
but was a cruel master over the poor Indians
who had to work hard at his bidding. Before the
white men came among them they had easy times,
swinging in their hammocks, bathing in the clear
waters, and eating the wild fruits which were so
plentiful.</p>

<p>Everything was changed after the arrival of the
cruel Spaniards.</p>

<p>"These white men are great and wise," the Indians
had thought at first. "We must serve them
and give them all we can. They wish gold. We
will show them where they can find it in the earth
and the beds of the rivers."</p>

<p>These poor savages of Porto Rico were gentle
creatures. They knew little about war. When they
found the Spaniards had no love for them and cared
for nothing except gold, it was too late to save themselves.
They were forced to wait upon their white
masters. They had to work in the gold mines as
they had never worked before. They missed the
pleasant sunlight. They became weak and sick.
Great numbers of them died.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>All this time Ponce de Leon was storing away
great piles of the gold the Indians brought him.
He made a poor governor. The king of Spain at
last sent word he should no longer rule over the
island of Porto Rico.</p>

<p>He was now growing old. He had been sick
many times. He began to think of what the Indians
had told him. They said:</p>

<p>"Much gold can be found in the land north of
us. Something better than gold can also be found
there. It is a wonderful fountain. If anyone tastes
of its waters he shall never be sick again but shall
be young forever."</p>

<p>The heart of the Spaniard leaped for joy. "That
is what I want," he said. "Such a fountain is indeed
better than all the gold in the world."</p>

<p>He might very easily say this, for he already had
all the gold he needed.</p>

<p>He started out with a gay company of his friends.
They sailed about among the islands, stopping here
and there to feast and make merry.</p>

<p>Still they sailed on toward the north till at last
they came in sight of a land beautiful with flowers.
It was a glorious Easter Sunday. The air was
sweet with delicious odors.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>"I will call this place Florida," said Ponce de
Leon, "because it is the Flowery Easter."</p>

<p>He and his men spent some time wandering about
through the country, always looking for the wonderful
fountain.</p>

<p>"It may be here," he would think as he picked
his way through a forest.</p>

<p>"Listen!" one of his friends would cry as he heard
the sound of running water and thought it might
be the Fountain of Youth they were seeking.</p>

<p>They were disappointed again and again. At last
they went back to the ships and sailed for Spain.
They had found plenty of fruits and flowers. They
had met many Indians, some of whom were friendly
and gentle, but others were fierce and warlike.
Their eager eyes never beheld the Fountain of
Youth.</p>

<p>Ponce de Leon did not give up his hope of finding
it, however. He told the king of Spain of the beautiful
country of Florida and that he hoped to find
gold there. The king said:</p>

<p>"You may be the governor of this new land if
you will take others with you and settle there."</p>

<p>The old man went back to Florida. Alas! he only
went to pain and trouble. As he was about to land,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
a party of Indians came out to meet him. They
were not willing to let the white men come on shore.
A fight took place. Ponce de Leon was shot. A
poisoned arrow entered his body and made a frightful
wound. He went back to the ship and set sail
for Cuba. His wound did not heal, for the poison
from the arrow was still working.</p>

<p>He never again tried to find the Fountain of
Youth, for he died in a few days.</p>

<p>"Nobody else ever found it, either," said Uncle
Sam as he finished the story.</p>

<p>"People used to have such silly notions," said one
of the party, as they packed up to go home.</p>

<p>"The more they traveled, the wiser they became,"
replied Uncle Sam. "There is nothing like travel
to make our minds grow. Some time I may go
round the world myself. I'm not too old yet."</p>

<p>"I hope you will let Joe and me go with you,"
said Lucy, as she took hold of his hand and pointed
to the waiting carriage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="small">THE GOOD KNIGHT AND THE LOST BABY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Joe</span> and Lucy were sitting on Uncle Sam's steps.
They were busy making daisy wreaths.</p>

<p>"We will put a double crown on Uncle Sam's
head," Lucy whispered. "Then we will play he is
the king of Spain sending Ponce de Leon to
Florida."</p>

<p>The old man heard her. "I shall look quite royal
with such a grand crown," he said with a laugh.
"But to-night you had better pretend I am England's
good Queen Bess. She lived long after John
Cabot. Let me see! It was about seventy-five years
from then to the time Walter Raleigh first met her."</p>

<p>"There! I've finished my wreath, so please let me
put it on your head. Then I'll be very still while
you talk to us," said Lucy.</p>

<p>"Mine is done, too," cried Joe.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Sam, you look just lovely," exclaimed
the little girl, standing up to admire her friend.</p>

<p>Then she and Joe settled themselves at his feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
to hear the story of Queen Elizabeth and her brave
knight:</p>

<p>A long time ago there was a little boy in England
named Walter Raleigh. He was a very beautiful
child and as brave as he was handsome.</p>

<p>While he was still very young he left his quiet
home in the country and went to war in other lands.
In a few years he came back to England. Now,
however, he was a tall, strong man, as brave and
handsome as ever.</p>

<p>One afternoon he dressed himself in rich and
beautiful clothes and went out to walk. He wore a
white satin vest, a brown doublet embroidered with
pearls, yellow shoes tied with white satin ribbons
and sparkling with precious stones, and a wide hat
trimmed with a long black plume. His dark hair
fell in curls over his shoulders. He was a grand
sight, indeed.</p>

<p>He had not walked far when lo! he saw Queen
Elizabeth coming that way. The ladies of her court
were with her. Suddenly the queen stopped. A
pool of muddy water stood in her pathway, for a
shower had fallen only a short time before.</p>

<p>What should she do? The queen stopped to think
how she could keep from wetting her dainty shoes.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span></p>

<p>No sooner had she done this than Walter Raleigh
stepped forward, threw off his rich cloak, and spread
it over the pool. A dry way was thus made for
the queen to pass over.</p>

<p>She turned to the young man and, thanking him,
gave him a sweet smile. Then she went on her way,
but she did not forget him. She asked her ladies
his name. When he afterwards appeared at court
she was ready to show him kindness.</p>

<p>She found that Walter Raleigh was not only a
true gentleman, but that he was also brave and wise.</p>

<p>He went to sea in the queen's ships and showed
that he was a good sailor. He fought in battles for
his country and proved that he was a fine soldier.
He read many books and wrote beautiful poems.
In those times, or any other times, it would be hard
to find a better, braver, finer gentleman than Walter
Raleigh.</p>

<p>For many years the English people had given little
thought to America. When they found John
Cabot did not discover a short way to India, they
lost interest in the New World.</p>

<p>Walter Raleigh, however, did not think like the
rest of his people.</p>

<p>"O Queen," he said to Elizabeth, "you are a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
ruler. But you could become more powerful still.
Why do you not claim some of that land across the
great ocean before Spain seizes all of it? We have
learned from sea captains who have been there lately
that it is rich in beautiful woods and many other
good things."</p>

<p>Raleigh hated the Spaniards and had already
fought against them in the wars. He knew they
were settled in Mexico, Florida, and the West Indies.
He did not wish them to get hold of the rest
of America. Neither he nor Elizabeth, however,
dreamed of the great size of the country.</p>

<p>"I will fit out some ships," the queen answered,
"and you may send people to settle on the land
which I will give you in America."</p>

<p>Two ships were made ready. The men who sailed
in them did not plan to settle in America. They
went only to look around and find a good place
where settlers could come afterward.</p>

<p>They landed on different islands near the shores
of the mainland. It was farther north than Florida.
The air was warm and pleasant. The explorers
found many fine trees of oak and cedar. Grapes
and melons, corn and peas, were plentiful.</p>

<p>The Indians whom they met seemed willing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
be friends. They admired the white skins of their
visitors and brought presents to them. The white
men gave them beads and other cheap ornaments.</p>

<p>The Englishmen stayed among them for several
weeks. The Indian women made feasts for their
visitors and bathed their feet and washed their
clothes. The time came at last when the white men
said:</p>

<p>"We must go back to England and tell about
this beautiful country. We will take home some
furs and skins and we will carry a bracelet of pearls
to Walter Raleigh."</p>

<p>How his eyes must have sparkled at the sight
of the pearls! They were as large as peas.</p>

<p>"The Indian women wear such pearls as ornaments,"
the sailors said. "The men often go about
with reeds in their mouths. Bowls of walnut shell
are fastened to these reeds and filled with the dried
leaves of a strange plant. Then the Indians set the
leaves on fire. They suck the smoke through the
reeds and blow it out of their mouths. They seem
to take great pleasure in doing this."</p>

<p>The sailors were speaking of the tobacco plant
and the smoking of its leaves. They had never
seen either before.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<p>Elizabeth was much pleased with what she heard.
She said:</p>

<p>"This beautiful country shall be called Virginia
in honor of myself."</p>

<p>The queen was not married. She sometimes said:
"I am wedded to my country, and that is enough."
It was because of this that she was often spoken of
as the "Virgin Queen." She always liked to be
called by this name.</p>

<p>At this time she made Walter Raleigh a knight
and that is why he has always since been called <i>Sir</i>
Walter Raleigh.</p>

<p>The next year he sent out one hundred people to
settle in Virginia. They must have been very brave
to seek a new home among the Red Men across the
great ocean. They landed on one of the islands
which their people had visited the year before.
They set to work at once to make a home for themselves.</p>

<p>It was not long before some rough houses were
built and English housekeeping was begun in
America.</p>

<p>The Indians were not as kind as they were the
year before. They were jealous of the white men.
They thought:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>"It was well enough for them to visit us, but we
do not wish them to live here."</p>

<p>They had good reasons for not liking the
strangers, for the white men did not treat them
wisely.</p>

<p>I will tell you of one thing that happened to
make the Indians angry. When the Englishmen
were on an exploring expedition a silver cup was
stolen.</p>

<p>"The Indians have taken it," they cried.</p>

<p>They were so angry they marched to an Indian
town near by and burned it to the ground. The
red people of the town fled into the woods, so no
harm was done to them. They were very angry,
however, because their homes were destroyed.
They said to one another:</p>

<p>"Let us drive the white strangers from our land.
They do us nothing but harm."</p>

<p>From this time the settlers were not safe. They
never knew when the Indians might attack them.
Many of them were sick and longed to go back to
England.</p>

<p>When summer came and an English ship sailed
into the harbor, most of them were glad to get on
board and bid good-bye to America.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>They carried back with them three things which
did not grow in England. These were Indian corn,
white potatoes, and tobacco.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Raleigh planted the potatoes at his
home in Ireland. The people there liked them so
much that potatoes were soon growing in every
part of the country. That is why they were afterwards
called "Irish potatoes."</p>

<p>As for the tobacco, Sir Walter became so fond
of smoking it that he was often seen with a pipe
in his mouth. Of course, this was then a strange
sight in Europe. The first time the knight's servant
saw his master smoking, he was frightened.
He thought Raleigh was on fire. He rushed forward
with a pitcher of water and dashed it over
his head. The sudden bath must have been a
surprise, but it probably made the good knight
laugh heartily.</p>

<p>Though the first settlers came back from America,
Raleigh thought:</p>

<p>"I will not give up so easily. Virginia is a
beautiful country. It will make a good home. I
will try again to make a settlement there."</p>

<p>The very next year he sent out a still larger
number of people. There were men, women and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
children. When they reached the island where
the first settlers had lived, they found the English
fort had been destroyed. Deer were roaming freely
through the deserted village.</p>

<p>They did not lose heart. They set to work and
new houses were soon built. They tried to make
friends with the Indians.</p>

<p>At this time a dear little baby was born. She
was named Virginia in honor of the queen and of
her parents' new home. She was the first white
child of English people born in this great land of
America.</p>

<p>Poor little Virginia Dare! You shall now
hear her sad story. Her grandfather was the governor
of the English settlement. After a while he
said to his people:</p>

<p>"I will sail back to England to get help, for
the Indians are not friendly to us."</p>

<p>He was gone a long time&mdash;much longer than
he expected to be. When he reached England he
found that war was going on, and Raleigh was
busy fighting for his country.</p>

<p>Two ships, however, were loaded with supplies
and started to America. Alas! they had not gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
far before they had a fight with the Spaniards and
were obliged to go back to England.</p>

<p>It was three years before Virginia's grandfather
was able to cross the ocean again. What long,
anxious years they must have been!</p>

<p>When he reached Virginia there was not one of
his people to greet him; no daughter to meet him
with smiles and kisses; no little grandchild to sit
on his knee and put her arms around his neck.</p>

<p>All were gone&mdash;the fort, the village, men, women,
and children. He looked about for a sign of what
had happened. This only met his eyes: It was
a tree into which these letters had been hurriedly
cut:</p>


<p class="center in0 p1t p1b">C-R-O-A-T-A-N</p>


<p>What was the meaning of these letters? Was
it to let him know that the white people could be
found among the Croatan Indians? Had they been
made prisoners by that tribe of Red Men? He
went to them and to other tribes in the country
around, but he was not able to learn anything about
his lost dear ones. At last he went back to England
with a sad heart.</p>

<p>No one knows to this day whether Virginia Dare
was killed by the Red Men or whether she lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
to grow up among their children and learn their
ways and language. She and her people are spoken
of to-day as "The Lost Colony."</p>

<p>When Sir Walter Raleigh heard the sad news
he was discouraged. He had spent all his money
and still had no colony. Queen Elizabeth died
a few years after this. King James, who now
ruled over England, was not his friend.</p>

<p>The king kept the brave knight in prison for
twelve long years. At last he ordered the good
Sir Walter Raleigh's head to be cut off.</p>

<p>This was the end of that brave Englishman, after
a life of good and noble deeds.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="small">THE STORY OF A DARING MAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">"What</span> a pity no one knows what became of
little Virginia Dare," said Lucy, sadly.
"I hope she wasn't killed by the Indians. I'd rather
think she died of the measles or scarlet fever."</p>

<p>"Poor little child," said Uncle Sam softly. "It
must have been a rough life for her in the wild
woods of the New World at that time, even if the
cruel savages had let her alone. My heart goes
out also to Sir Walter Raleigh, for he worked so
hard to have English people settle here. The saddest
part of it is that he did not succeed.</p>

<p>"He lived long enough, however, to hear of other
people going to Virginia and making a home there.
They would surely have failed, too, if it had not
been for Captain John Smith."</p>

<p>"What a common name that is," said Joe. "I
know two boys named John Smith."</p>

<p>"A common enough name, to be sure," answered
Uncle Sam. "But the John Smith I am thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
of was very different from any other. If you children
can stay long enough this evening, I will
tell you about him."</p>

<p>"Mother said we needn't come home till eight
o'clock unless you got tired of us before that time."</p>

<p>"The idea of my getting tired of you and Joe,
Lucy! I would be a lonely old man if it were
not for you children. You help to keep me young.
I can't think what I should do, either, if I had no
one to listen to the stories that keep running through
my head. Just now it is fairly bursting with the
brave deeds of John Smith."</p>

<p>"Dear me! Don't let it burst, Uncle Sam. Do
begin the story this very minute," cried Lucy, trying
to look frightened.</p>

<p>A moment afterward the little sitting-room was
so still that anyone could have heard the big clock
ticking in the corner. Then Uncle Sam began
to tell of the strange life of</p>


<p class="center in0 p2t p1b">CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a little boy who lived
on a farm in England.</p>

<p>When he was born his father and mother said,
"We will call our son John."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as he was old enough he was set to work
at a trade. His parents were poor and they thought,
"It is a good thing to have a trade, for then a man
can always get his own living."</p>

<p>The young John Smith could not agree with
them. He did not like his work, so he did what
other boys sometimes do. He ran away. Then
his troubles began, for he had a hard life. He
tried all sorts of things.</p>

<p>He became a soldier and later he went to sea and
was out in such a terrible storm that his ship was
wrecked. Again he was out in a ship when another
storm came up.</p>

<p>"John Smith carries bad luck wherever he goes,"
the men whispered to each other. "He has brought
this storm upon us."</p>

<p>They threw him overboard. As he was a good
swimmer and not far from land, he managed to
reach the shore in safety.</p>

<p>This is only one of the stories John Smith told
of his strange life when he was a young man.</p>

<p>Not long after that adventure he took part in
a war against the Turks. He was as brave as
ever, for at one time he killed three Turks and cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
off their heads. He had no one to help him do it,
either.</p>

<p>He did not succeed as well afterwards, for the
Turks caught him and made him a slave. His
cruel master fastened an iron collar around his neck
and made him work very hard. He had to thresh
wheat.</p>

<p>One day when he was working in the wheat field
his Turkish master rode up on horseback and began
to whip him. How angry he was! He seized
his heavy flail and killed the Turk with one blow.</p>

<p>He must lose no time in getting away now. He
lifted a bag of wheat to the back of the horse,
jumped up behind it, and off he rode as fast as he
could go.</p>

<p>He wandered through the wilderness for a long
time. At last he reached the seashore and got on
board an English ship. When he reached England
there were many people ready to listen to his
wonderful adventures.</p>

<p>On the other hand, John Smith heard many
stories about the land across the great ocean&mdash;of
little Virginia Dare and her lost people, and of
the Red Men who lived such a free life in the forests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
of America. This was not all, however, for
people were saying:</p>

<p>"Why not try again to settle in Virginia? It
is a beautiful country. The weather is warm and
pleasant there. It must be easy enough to live
in such a place, if we can only get along with the
Indians."</p>

<p>John Smith eagerly listened to all this talk. England
was too quiet for him. He did not enjoy his
life there, he liked excitement too well. He said:</p>

<p>"If a party sails to Virginia I should like to
join it."</p>

<p>He soon had a chance, for a number of men
were at that time getting ready to start. They
were not the best kind of people to make a new
home in a strange land. Very few of them knew
how to do any kind of work. They had heard
that the Spaniards found gold in America. They
thought they themselves might pick it up on the
ground in Virginia. They said to each other:</p>

<p>"We will get rich in the easiest way in the
world."</p>

<p>They did not know how hard work it would be
to make themselves safe, as well as comfortable.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>They settled at a place they called Jamestown,
in honor of James, the king of England.</p>

<p>When the Red Men saw these newcomers, they
were not pleased. They were not willing to have
the Englishmen settle in their country. They said:</p>

<p>"We will kill these white men before they have a
chance to save themselves."</p>

<p>The English were taken by surprise. They did
not have their guns with them when the Indians
drew near with their bows and arrows. It would
have been a sad day for John Smith and his party
if the Indians had not been frightened off.</p>

<p>Something came whizzing over their heads. The
next moment the branch of a tree came tumbling
down in the midst of them.</p>

<p>"It is thunder," they thought. "The Great
Spirit is angry with us."</p>

<p>They fled from the place as fast as their legs
would carry them. They did not stop to look
around to see what had happened. If they had
seen, they would not have understood.</p>

<p>But the white men knew. Some of their friends
on board of the ship had seen their danger. They
had fired a cross-bar shot from a cannon. That
was a bar of iron with a cannon-ball at each end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Such shot are not allowed to be used now-a-days.</p>

<p>Although John Smith and his friends were saved
at this time, many other troubles were waiting for
them.</p>

<p>They made some houses to live in, but made
them so poorly that they leaked and were very
damp. They had brought food with them, but
there was not enough to last long. It is not strange
that many of the party became sick and died.</p>

<p>Those who still lived looked at the gardens of the
Indians with a great longing. They watched the
fields of corn waving in the breeze, and when it was
ripe they tried to buy the grain.</p>

<p>They could not get it by offering money to the
Red Men, for the savages had no use for money&mdash;that
is, for our kind of money. John Smith said
to his people:</p>

<p>"I will tell you what I will do. I will take some
beads and other cheap trinkets and will go up the
river in a boat. I can surely get some corn if I
am willing to give the trinkets in return."</p>

<p>When the Indians saw the beads, bits of looking-glass,
and other ornaments, they longed to have
them. They wanted them so much that they gladly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
gave Smith a boatload of corn. In this way he
saved his people from sickness and death.</p>

<p>These white men called themselves "gentlemen."
They had never done any work in England. John
Smith showed them they could only save their
lives by work. It must be hard work, too.</p>

<p>If it had not been for him they would not have
known enough even to build their houses. He
taught them how to plough the ground and plant
corn so as to raise a crop for themselves. He said
to them:</p>

<p>"We ought to protect our settlement by setting
up a wall of stakes around it."</p>

<p>Such a wall is called a palisade. It would have
been helpful in keeping their enemies away. The
wall was not built, however. The men were lazy
and they thought:</p>

<p>"Captain Smith cannot be right. We are able
to defend ourselves without any palisade."</p>

<p>King James very much wished the settlers to
look for three things. They were to search for
Virginia Dare and her people; they must find gold,
and they were also to look for some waterway
through the land leading to the Pacific Ocean, or
the South Sea, as it was then called.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>It was more than a hundred years since Columbus
discovered America. Yet still no one dreamed
of the size of this country. How surprised John
Smith and his people would have been to learn
that they would have to travel three thousand miles
westward before they reached another ocean.</p>

<p>As soon as Captain Smith had a chance he sailed
along the shores and up the rivers. He was looking
for a way to reach the South Sea. One day he
went up the James River in a boat with two of his
friends. They came to another and smaller river
flowing into the James.</p>

<p>"Let us see where this will carry us," said Smith.</p>

<p>They went on and on. The river became narrower
and narrower. At last Smith jumped ashore and
left the other two men in charge of the boat. He
told them to guard it and on no account to leave it
for a minute. He would go inland to see what
he could find.</p>

<p>He had not gone far when some Indians crept
out of the woods. They took the two men by surprise
and killed them. Then the savages hurried
after Smith. He fought hard and managed to
make a prisoner of one of the Indians.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash, he bound his prisoner in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
of him. In this way he made a shield for himself.
The Indians could not shoot at the white man without
running the risk of killing one of their own
people.</p>

<p>By this time they had driven Smith into a swamp.
The brave man was sinking deeper and deeper into
the mud. It was not long before he sank up to his
waist in it. He could no longer run nor fight. He
would have to give himself up.</p>

<p>He made a sign to his enemies that he would let
them take him.</p>

<p>Even after they had taken him ashore he had
hope. With quick thought he drew a small compass
from his pocket and offered it to the leader of
the party. He told the Indian to look at the needle.
He showed how it pointed. He explained that
anyone who carried it could tell in what direction
he was going.</p>

<p>The savage was so pleased that he would not let
the others do Smith any harm. They started for
their home with their prisoner. They did not travel
like white men. They walked in single file and
made no noise.</p>

<p>They carried Smith to several Indian villages.
Everyone was curious to see him. Many of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
people had never looked at a white man before.
They said to each other:</p>

<p>"Is he a friend or an enemy to us? He is certainly
very wise and brave."</p>

<p>They looked at the compass and saw that it would
really tell directions. They thought:</p>

<p>"No common man could have such a wonderful
thing as that."</p>

<p>Smith wrote a letter to his friends in Jamestown
and asked the Indians to send it to them. When
the Red Men had done this and found that those
queer marks on a piece of paper told a story to the
white men, they were even more surprised. They
said:</p>

<p>"We do not dare to kill our prisoner, he is too
powerful."</p>

<p>What should they do with him? While they
were trying to make up their minds about this, they
kept Smith shut up in a hut. They were not cruel
to him, however. O, no. They brought him
quantities of food to eat. There were bread made
of corn, roasted deer meat, and all the dainties
which they themselves liked best. Smith thought:</p>

<p>"They are trying to make me fat before they
kill me."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>This thought took away all wish for food. The
poor man could scarcely eat.</p>

<p>Day after day went by until at last the Red Men
said:</p>

<p>"We will take our prisoner to the great chief,
Powhatan, and he will tell us what to do."</p>

<p>Smith was brought out and carried in a strange
procession to the village in which the chief was
then living. He was kept there for some time before
the chief would receive him.</p>

<p>When the day came at last, Powhatan was dressed
in the grandest Indian fashion. He wore a long
robe made of feathers. His face and arms were
painted. His people stood around him. He
wished Smith to think he was great and powerful.</p>

<p>The white man was brought before him. Smith
eagerly watched to see if there were any signs
of mercy in the stern face.</p>

<p>Powhatan talked for some time with his warriors.
Then two of them got up and went to the
side of their white prisoner.</p>

<p>They led him off a short distance and stretched
him out on the ground. They placed his head on
a stone.</p>

<p>"They are going to kill me," Smith said to himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
"I am bound so tightly I cannot possibly get
away. There is no help for me now."</p>

<p>Then a strange thing happened. Just as one
of the Indians raised his club to end the white man's
life, a young girl rushed to his side. She was Powhatan's
favorite daughter. She threw her arms
around Smith's neck. Then, turning toward her
father, she cried:</p>

<p>"Spare this man's life for my sake."</p>

<p>The beautiful girl had grown to love Smith during
his stay in the village. While he was shut up
as a prisoner he had made whistles and strings of
beads for her. His kindness pleased her and her
gentle heart was filled with pity for the white man.</p>

<p>Powhatan could not refuse the daughter he loved
so dearly. He said:</p>

<p>"I will spare the man's life for the sake of my
child. He shall stay among us and spend his time
making ornaments for Pocahontas."</p>

<p>This is the story Smith afterwards told of the
time when he was in the hands of the Indians.
Some people, however, do not believe it is quite all
true.</p>

<p>At any rate, his life was saved and Pocahontas
was the friend of the white people ever after.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>

<p>In a few weeks Powhatan said to John Smith:</p>

<p>"You may go back to Jamestown if you will
promise to send me two cannons and a grindstone
as soon as you arrive."</p>

<p>Smith was quite willing to make the promise.</p>

<p>When he was once more safe among his own
people he found they were in great trouble. Some
of them were planning to run away in the only
large boat. The others would then be left to the
mercy of the Red Men. They were all much in
need of their wise leader.</p>

<p>The promise to Powhatan was not forgotten.
The Indians, however, who had come back with
Smith to get the cannons and the grindstone could
not carry them home. They were too heavy. So
the men were quite willing to take some trinkets
instead.</p>

<p>Many times after that the people of Jamestown
suffered because they did not have enough to eat.
They were saved again and again by Pocahontas,
who filled her boat with baskets of corn and paddled
down the river to her white friends.</p>

<p>One evening she heard her people making a plan.
They said:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>"We will creep upon the Englishmen and take
them by surprise. Then we will kill them."</p>

<p>She was brave as well as good. She did not lose
a moment, but hurried away through the dark
woods. She did not stop till she reached Jamestown.
Then she told of the Indians' plot. She
warned Smith to be on his guard. Then she hurried
away into the darkness once more.</p>

<p>The white men tried again and again to make
friends with Powhatan. They gave him a bedstead,
a red cloak, and a wash-basin. They
thought he would now be willing to sell them corn.</p>

<p>Not so, however. After he received these presents,
the great chief became so proud he would not
think of trading with the Englishmen.</p>

<p>They were almost starving when Smith thought
of a new plan. He took a box of blue glass beads
and showed them to Powhatan. He said:</p>

<p>"These beads are made of the same stuff as the
sky itself."</p>

<p>When the chief heard this he longed to have some
for his own. What precious things they must be!</p>

<p>"I will sell you a boatload of corn for those
beads," he promised.</p>

<p>"You will see by this that Captain Smith did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
always tell the truth. It was because of just such
deceits as this that the white men afterwards had
so much trouble with the Indians," said Uncle Sam.</p>

<p>The corn was just what Smith wanted, but he
would not let the savages know how glad he was.
His boat was quickly filled with the precious grain
and he set out for Jamestown with a happy heart.</p>

<p>His troubles were not yet at an end. One day
while he was at work, a bag of gunpowder exploded
near him. Poor Captain Smith was badly burned
and in great pain. Worse still, the burned flesh
did not heal after many days.</p>

<p>"I cannot get well here. I must go back to
England," he told his friends.</p>

<p>With a sad heart he bade them good-bye and
left them to get along as well as they could by
themselves.</p>

<p>When Captain John Smith had gone, one trouble
after another fell upon the people of Jamestown.
They came near starving to death. They
were glad to eat anything which would keep them
alive. Dogs, snakes, and even toads were killed
for food.</p>

<p>Most of the men had already died when some
ships came sailing into the harbor. They brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
some more settlers, as well as food and clothing
from England. The worst was now over.</p>

<p>Pocahontas was still the friend of the white men.
She grew up to be a beautiful young woman and
married an Englishman named John Rolfe. The
wedding took place in a little church at Jamestown.</p>

<p>From that time the great chief Powhatan was
the friend of the white men.</p>

<p>The rest of the story of Pocahontas is soon told.
She was a good wife to John Rolfe, and a year
after they were married they had a lovely baby boy.
John Rolfe went to England on business and took
his wife and baby with him. The beautiful Pocahontas
was invited to court by the king. She
was treated with great honor as an Indian princess,
but it did not make her vain or silly.</p>

<p>While she was in England she met her old friend
John Smith. She had been told that he was dead
and she was much moved at seeing him.</p>

<p>Alas! Pocahontas did not live to see her own
home again. Just as she was about to sail to
America a dreadful sickness came up her. It was
the smallpox. She died in a few days, but her
baby son went back with his father to Jamestown
and lived to be a noble man.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>John Smith is often called the father of Virginia.
After his burns had healed, he left England in
search of new adventures.</p>

<p>He sailed again to the shores of America. He
came to a place much farther north than Jamestown.
He looked upon a land with rocky shores.
It was not like Virginia. He called this part of
America "New England" and so it has been called
ever since.</p>

<p>Smith sailed all along the shores of New England.
He went in and out of its bays and harbors.
He made a good map of what he saw. Then
he went back to his own country to show his map
to the king.</p>

<p>The next year he sailed on his last voyage. This
time he wished to settle in New England. He
met with many troubles. There was a dreadful
storm and he was chased by pirates. Last of all,
he was overtaken by a fleet of French ships and
made a prisoner. After a while he managed to
escape and get back to England.</p>

<p>This brave and daring man lived long enough to
hear of other people settling in New England. That
is another story, however.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p>As Uncle Sam stopped speaking, Joe jumped up,
crying:</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Captain John Smith! Next to
Columbus he was the bravest man I ever heard
of. I wish I could have seen him kill that Turk."</p>

<p>"I should have liked to have been there when he
offered those blue beads to Powhatan," said Lucy.
"He must have been laughing inside when he did
it."</p>

<p>"As for me, I like to think of his making those
lazy Englishmen do some work," said Uncle Sam,
stroking his chin.</p>

<p>The neighbors all said there was no laziness about
Uncle Sam, so it is no wonder he spoke as he did.</p>

<p>"Uncle Sam is like John Smith in some ways,"
the children's father said not long afterwards.</p>

<p>He had come into the back yard where Joe was
stretched on the ground with Lucy's arms around
his neck.</p>

<p>"We are playing that I am John Smith and Lucy
is Pocahontas. She is trying to save my life. Uncle
Sam told us all about them." Joe sat up to
explain.</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Sam is a good deal like John Smith.
He is afraid of nothing. He is always busy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
he can turn his hand to anything. One time when
he was a boy he was out sailing. The sail was
an old one and a sudden gust of wind caught it
and tore it badly. Uncle Sam was a long way
from home and the sun was already setting. Quick
as a thought he took off his shirt, tore it open, and
patched the sail with it. That was the very thing
John Smith did when he was away from Jamestown
on one of his excursions."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Lucy. There is no use in being
afraid of anything. You should have lived long
ago among the Dutchmen in New York. They
would have told you it wasn't thunder, but was
the sound made by Henry Hudson and his men

<p class="center in0 p2t p1b">HENRY HUDSON AND THE DUTCHMEN</p>

<p>It is nearly three hundred years since John Smith
went to Jamestown. He left a dear friend in England
who was also a great sea captain. His name
was Henry Hudson.</p>

<p>At that time England was jealous of Spain because
of her riches. The Spaniards had found
many gold and silver mines in America.</p>

<p>England was also jealous of Portugal, a small
country joining Spain. The Portuguese had found
a way of reaching India by sailing southward
around Africa and then eastward. They brought
home shiploads of gums, spices, precious stones
and rare woods. So the Englishmen thought:</p>

<p>"We must get rich, too. Why cannot we reach
India by sailing to the northeast or the northwest?"</p>

<p>They looked about for a brave and able captain
who should find out if this could be done. They
chose Henry Hudson.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>He sailed into the northern seas. He met with
icebergs that made the air very cold when they
were still a long way off. He saw many whales.</p>

<p>Henry Hudson and his men killed some of the
whales. They boiled the fat and made many barrels
of oil. This was the best oil known at that
time for burning in lamps. It was also useful in
other ways.</p>

<p>The brave captain sailed far into the northern
seas. It was now so cold that great masses of ice
almost stopped the ship.</p>

<p>"We must turn back," Henry Hudson said to his
men. "It is of no use to sail any farther northward
in hopes of finding a passage to India."</p>

<p>When he got back to England, the people were
pleased to learn about the whales. They sent more
ships to capture the great monsters and bring home
the oil.</p>

<p>Once more they sent Henry Hudson to look for
a short way to India by a northern passage.</p>

<p>Again he failed because of the ice in the waters,
and again he came home disappointed.</p>

<p>About this time the people of Holland heard
of Henry Hudson and what he was trying to do.
People who live in that country are called Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
or Dutchmen. It was a rich country for so few people.
They said:</p>

<p>"We had better send for this English captain.
We will get him to sail in our ships. We do not
wish the Englishmen to find a shorter way to India
than we know now. If they do, they will become
richer than we are."</p>

<p>So they sent for Hudson. They offered him
such good pay that he went to Holland and made
ready to take one of their ships into the north. As
he was about to sail he received a letter from his
old friend John Smith.</p>

<p>The letter told him he should sail to the westward
if he wished to find the best way of reaching India.
Just north of Virginia there was a narrow strait.
If a ship passed through that strait, it would enter
the ocean that washes the shores of India.</p>

<p>We all know now that Captain John Smith was
wrong about this. But Henry Hudson thought it
must be true.</p>

<p>He turned his ship, the Half Moon, towards the
west. He sailed in that direction till he reached
the shores of Newfoundland. Then he went southward
as far as Virginia, keeping near the coast.
He now turned his ship about and slowly sailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
to the north. He entered many of the bays and
coves that reached into the land. He was always
on the lookout for the strait of which Smith had
written.</p>

<p>At last he sailed into a fine harbor which no
white men had ever seen before. We call it to-day
the harbor of New York and know it is one of the
best in the world.</p>

<p>Indians came down to the shore in crowds. They
were curious to see the strange-looking boat and
the people with the white faces and hands. The
Red Men wore feather cloaks and necklaces of copper.
They wished to make friends with their
visitors and offered them beans, oysters, and tobacco.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful country this is!" the white
men thought.</p>

<p>There were sweet smells in the air and the open
places along the shore were covered with grass
and flowers. The ship did not remain long in the
harbor. Hudson found he was at the mouth of
a river. He thought:</p>

<p>"Who knows but that if I follow this river I may
reach the Pacific Ocean?"</p>

<p>So the ship sailed farther and farther up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
river. It stopped at several places where friendly
Indians came out to meet the white men. Hudson
landed at one of these places and visited an Indian
chief.</p>

<p>In the village he saw great piles of corn and
beans. He noticed the bark houses. The Red
Men asked him to stay all night with them and
placed a mat on the ground for him to sit on. They
brought him food in a red wooden bowl.</p>

<p>They wished to show that they were truly his
friends, so they took some arrows and threw them
into the fire. This told him more than the Indian
words he could not understand.</p>

<p>When he sailed again, Hudson noticed that the
river was getting narrower. At last it was so
shallow that his ship could go no farther. He
sent some men in a small boat to see what they
could find.</p>

<p>"This is no way to the Pacific," they said when
they came back. "The river comes to an end just
beyond us."</p>

<p>The ship was turned about, and Hudson sailed
down the river and out into the harbor again.
He gave his own name to the river he had discovered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
and it is still called the Hudson River.
He never saw it again.</p>

<p>Now came the long voyage across the ocean.
The Dutch people were sorry that Hudson had not
found what he was looking for. They were pleased,
however, to learn of the lovely country and the
wild animals covered with fur that were to be
found in its forests.</p>

<p>"The Indians are pleasant and willing to be
friends. They kill great numbers of the wild animals
with their bows and arrows and they tan the
skins." So the sailors said.</p>

<p>"Why not send some of our people to live on
the shores of the Hudson River?" thought the
thrifty Dutch. "They can carry with them shiploads
of knives, axes, beads, and other things the
Red Men like. They can trade those things for
the furs that bring high prices here in Europe."</p>

<p>This is how it happened that the Dutch people
came to settle in America.</p>

<p>They brought chests full of linen, as well as the
shining pewter dishes they used in housekeeping.
In fact, they packed in their ships everything they
needed to make themselves comfortable and happy.</p>

<p>When they built their houses in America they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
made them look as much as possible like the homes
they left behind them. They made their fireplaces
large enough to hold logs of great size. In the
cold winter evenings these logs crackled and burned
brightly while the Dutchmen with their wives and
children sat before the fire and told stories.</p>

<p>Every house had a porch. As the sun set and
the moon came out in the summer time, the men
sat in the porches telling stories and smoking their
pipes while their wives sat knitting beside them
and the children romped and played around the
dooryards.</p>

<p>They still dressed in the fashions of their country.
The men had hats with broad brims and coats
with wide skirts. The women wore so many short
skirts they looked like opened umbrellas.</p>

<p>These Dutch people were honest and they had
kind hearts, so they got along pretty well with
their Indian neighbors. They hated idleness and
they were very neat.</p>

<p>All of them worked during the day, but when
evening came it was a time for rest and pleasure.
Then were told the stories of the old days in Holland,
of fairies, and of the gnomes who lived underground
digging copper and gold.</p>

<p>When the thunder rolled in the sky, they would
nod to each other and say: "It is only Henry Hudson
and his men playing ninepins with the dwarfs
in the caves of the Catskill mountains."</p>

<p>You shall now hear how this queer fancy came
into their heads.</p>

<p>After the brave captain had discovered the Hudson
River and gone back to Europe, he tried once
more to find a short way to India. He thought
it best to cross the ocean again, but to sail farther
north than he had done on his first voyage to this
country.</p>

<p>After he had reached the shores of America, he
came into a large bay. The land around him was
bare and dreary. The ship was kept all winter in
this bay on account of the ice. The sailors suffered
very much from the bitter cold. Many of
them became sick and died before the spring opened
and the ice broke up enough to let the ship move on.</p>

<p>By this time the food was almost gone. The
day came when Hudson took the last of the bread
and divided it among his crew. He was so sad
and hopeless that tears filled his eyes.</p>

<p>The sailors blamed him for bringing them there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
and were very angry with him. They thought, "We
shall all lose our lives through him."</p>

<p>They were not even moved by his tears. When
they had eaten the bread, they seized him and put
him and some sick sailors into a small boat. Then
they sent them adrift in the cold, dreary waters
of the great bay.</p>

<p>They were never heard of again. This is all we
know of the last days of that very brave Englishman,
Captain Henry Hudson.</p>

<p>As for the wicked sailors, some of them met with
better fortune than they deserved. Soon after they
had treated their captain so badly, birds came flying
by. The men shot some of these and saved themselves
from starving. After that they had a fight
with Indians on the shore and several of the sailors
were killed. The others managed to gather a small
supply of food with which they started for home.</p>

<p>Even then they suffered a great deal from hunger.
They were so weak they had to sit down to
sail the vessel. All of them would have died if
they had not met another ship, which took them
aboard and carried them home.</p>

<p>Long before Uncle Sam had finished the story,
the thunder-storm had passed by.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>"I hardly noticed it. I was thinking all the
time about Henry Hudson," declared Lucy.</p>

<p>"I suppose Hudson never met his old friend John
Smith after he got the letter," said Uncle Sam,
thoughtfully. Then he went on, "They were both
Englishmen, yet those who settled in Virginia
with John Smith made a very different home for
themselves from those made by the Dutch who
followed Henry Hudson.</p>

<p>"The Dutch had their own ways; the English
had theirs. The Dutch planted gardens. They
raised flocks of sheep, which furnished wool for
the women to card and spin. They gave beads
and blankets of red wool to their Indian neighbors.
They took in return game and beautiful
furs. They sent the furs to Holland.</p>

<p>"They got up in the morning at sunrise, and
went to bed at sunset. They ate dinner at eleven
o'clock in the morning, and tea parties were often
given at three in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"They had grand times at Christmas and New
Year's, when feasts were spread and everyone
dressed in his best clothes.</p>

<p>"It was the Dutchmen who gave Santa Claus
to American children. They brought the dear old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
fellow from Holland along with their chests of
linen and pewter dishes."</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the Dutchmen! I say," exclaimed
Joe. "Christmas wouldn't be half the fun it is
without Santa Claus. Do you know, Uncle Sam,
last year was the first time Lucy and I knew he was
not a real man. Why, we used to think he came
down our chimney every Christmas Eve with his
pack of presents. We talked up the chimney to
him when we went to bed and told him what we
wanted. I know now that you and father and
mother are the only Santa Claus."</p>

<p>"Now I think of it, the pictures of Santa Claus
make him look like a fat and jolly old Dutchman,"
said Lucy.</p>

<p>"After their people were well settled, the children
of Virginia enjoyed Christmas," Uncle Sam
went on. "They lived on big plantations where
their fathers raised tobacco. The houses were large
and pleasant. Beautiful trees grew near and gave
plenty of shade in the hot summer time.</p>

<p>"At Christmas, wild turkeys were roasted in the
big fireplaces. The rooms were trimmed with holly
and evergreens. There were dinner parties, and
dances that lasted all night. The ladies wore flowered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
silk dresses with long trains. Their hair was
powdered and 'done up' on the head so it looked
like a tower. The men wore knee-breeches and
shoes with bright buckles. Their coats were of
silk or velvet and trimmed with much gold and
silver lace.</p>

<p>"The white people in Virginia did not work
hard. They made their black slaves care for the
great fields of tobacco.</p>

<p>"'Where did the black men come from?' I see
the question in Lucy's eyes."</p>

<p>Uncle Sam stopped for a moment to stroke his
chin and slyly pull Joe's hair, for the boy had turned
his head to look at his sister.</p>

<p>"Ouch! That isn't fair, Uncle Sam," cried Joe.
"I will try to forgive you, though, if you don't do it
again and go on with your story."</p>

<p>"The Dutch were the first ones to bring slaves
to Virginia. They sailed to Africa and caught
the poor savages in their homes. Then they carried
them on board ship and afterwards sold them
to the white planters in America. That is one
way the Dutch became rich.</p>

<p>"You may praise the Dutch for giving you Santa
Claus, Joe. You may blame them, however, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
being the first to bring the dreadful curse of slavery
to this beautiful land."</p>

<p>Uncle Sam was getting excited.</p>

<p>"We may thank the Lord for sending us a good
helper. It is because of that helper that the people
of America are now free."</p>

<p>The old man got up and made a deep bow before
a picture hanging above the organ.</p>

<p>"There is the face of one who loved his fellow
men," he said, pointing to the picture.</p>

<p>"When you children know a little more about
your country, you shall hear the story of Abraham
Lincoln."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="small">THE PILGRIMS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">"I</span> think mother cooks the best Thanksgiving
dinners in the world," said Joe, with a sleepy
yawn. "It seems as though I could never be
hungry again."</p>

<p>"It is no wonder you feel as you do. I don't
see where in that small body of yours you were
able to stow away so much turkey and mince pie,
to say nothing of the squash and mashed potatoes,
the cranberry sauce, nuts and raisins," said Uncle
Sam. "I wonder if you ever thought why we
celebrate Thanksgiving Day. The people of other
countries do not have this holiday. If you are
not too sleepy I will tell you about it."</p>

<p>Uncle Sam had been spending the day with the
parents of Joe and Lucy. The children's mother
had said, "Thanksgiving wouldn't be Thanksgiving
without Uncle Sam to share it with us. Even if
my sister Mary comes with her whole family, we
can make room at the table for our dear old friend."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>The great dinner had been eaten and cleared
away. The short day was coming to an end when
Uncle Sam spoke of a reason for Thanksgiving Day.</p>

<p>"Sleepy! I guess not. A story is just the thing
before the lamps are lighted and we play games,"
said Lucy.</p>

<p>"Just the thing," repeated her cousin Mabel.
She was a year younger than Lucy and copied everything
the older girl said and did.</p>

<p>"We all like stories," added Arthur, a tall boy
of ten years. He was quiet and fond of books&mdash;very
different from noisy Joe, who loved him the
best of all his cousins.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time," began Uncle Sam, "there
were some people who lived in England. They
were good and honest, but they could not do just
as they wished. The king said everyone in the
country must worship God in a certain way. That
way must be the same in every church.</p>

<p>"It happened that some of his people did not
agree with the king. They said: 'Everyone
ought to worship God, but all should be free to
worship in the way they like best.'</p>

<p>"These people gathered together, and every Sunday
they met in their own little churches. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
did not please the king and he made their lives
very unpleasant.</p>

<p>"Of course they were not happy. They thought:
'Why should we stay here in England where we are
treated so badly? Holland is not far away and
the Dutch people are kind and friendly. They
are willing that everyone in their country should
worship as he likes. Let us go to Holland where
we can be free.'</p>

<p>"The plan seemed good. A small company of
men, women and children left England for a home
among the Dutch.</p>

<p>"At first, they were happy and contented in Holland.
The boys and girls became men and women.
The babies grew up into boys and girls. One thing
grieved their parents. Their children were fast
forgetting the English language. There were no
English schools where they could learn their lessons.</p>

<p>"'This is not right,' said the older ones. 'No
people could be kinder than our Dutch friends, but
we do not wish our own children to grow up and
forget their own country and the beautiful English
language.'</p>

<p>"'I will tell you what we can do,' said one. 'We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
have heard a good deal about America. Some of
our people have settled in Virginia. They write
that it is a fine place and that the air is soft and
pleasant all the year. Let us go to America. We
will seek a home not far from Virginia.'</p>

<p>"The others thought these were wise words.
They left their Dutch friends and went back to
England. They wished to visit it once more before
they bade it good-bye forever.</p>

<p>"Two ships were soon ready and one hundred
pilgrims sailed for America in the year 1620.</p>

<p>"'We are like pilgrims,' they had said to each
other, 'for we travel from place to place.' From
that day to this they have been called by the name
of the 'Pilgrims.'</p>

<p>"They had not sailed far before one of the ships
began to leak. Its captain said: 'It is not safe to
cross the ocean in such a poor boat.' So he turned
back to England.</p>

<p>"All the Pilgrims now crowded into the second
ship. It was called the 'Mayflower.'</p>

<p>"A long voyage was before the travelers. They
were tossed about by storm and wind. Almost all
of them were seasick. A hundred people in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
small cabin of the Mayflower must surely have had
a hard time.</p>

<p>"Land was sighted at last. It was their first
view of their future home, America. How happy
the children must have felt when they thought of
running and playing on dry land once more!</p>

<p>"It was in November when they sailed around
the end of Cape Cod. The Pilgrims had not meant
to come so far north of Virginia.</p>

<p>"Some of the men left the ship and went on
shore. They found a place where the earth looked
as though it had been lately dug up. Perhaps
something was buried in this spot. Sure enough!
It was some dried corn which the Indians had put
there for safe keeping.</p>

<p>"The men were pleased at the goodly sight. They
carried the corn to the ship. 'We may have need
of it,' they said. They were honest people, so when
they afterwards found out what Indians had stored
the corn there, they paid for it quite willingly.</p>

<p>"A brave man named Miles Standish had come
with the Pilgrims. He was English, like themselves.
They first met him while they were living
in Holland. He had gone there to help the Dutch
in a war against Spain.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p>"Miles Standish did not belong to the same
church as the Pilgrims, yet the more he knew them,
the better he liked them. When they spoke of
coming to America he said:</p>

<p>"'I will go with you to your new home.'</p>

<p>"They were much pleased, for he was a brave
and able soldier. He could help them if they had
trouble with the Indians.</p>

<p>"After they found the corn, some one proposed
to go along the coast in a small boat. It would be
the best way of finding a place to settle. As they
moved along, they saw some huts covered with
mats. They thought these must be the homes of
Indians.</p>

<p>"They went back to the ship without finding a
place to settle. Some days after that they started
out again. It was a very cold day in December.
The spray froze as it fell on their clothing.</p>

<p>"When they were several miles from the ship
they landed and made ready to spend the night out
of doors. They built a wall of logs. They said:</p>

<p>"'We can sleep behind this wall. Then if the
Indians should creep upon us, we can defend ourselves.'</p>

<p>"They had no trouble during the night, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
the morning there was a terrible sound. It was
not like anything they had ever heard before. It was
the warwhoop of the Indians.</p>

<p>"'The guns!' They were in the boat where the
men had just carried them. There was a quick
rush to the shore, while arrows came whizzing
about their heads. Then 'Bang! bang!' went the
guns, and the frightened Indians ran back into
the woods.</p>

<p>"The Indians thought the white men carried
thunder and lightning in the iron tubes. Although
brave, they could not stand against such fearful
weapons.</p>

<p>"The explorers hastened away. After a while
they came into a small harbor. The land along
the shore had been cleared of woods. Brooks
flowed through it into the sea.</p>

<p>"'This would be a good place for our people to
live,' Miles Standish thought. The others thought
so too.</p>

<p>"John Smith had visited this very place before
and had marked it on his map. As soon as the men
came back, the ship set sail and brought the pilgrims
to the chosen spot.</p>

<p>"'God's will has led us here,' thought the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
people. 'It must be the best place for our new
home.'</p>

<p>"One hundred persons had left England, but one
hundred and two landed on Plymouth Rock. How
was that?"</p>

<p>Uncle Sam smiled as he looked at the faces of
the wondering children.</p>

<p>"This was the way of it. Two babies had come
to the Pilgrims on their way to America. One
was born in mid-ocean, so they called him Oceanus.
The other was a little girl who first saw the daylight
when her people were near the shores of their
new home.</p>

<p>"'We will name her Peregrine,' said her parents.
'Peregrine means wanderer, and she is a little wanderer,
without doubt.'</p>

<p>"How good it must have seemed to the women
and children when they left the small, close cabin
and the dirty ship. They had to live on board,
however, until the men had built a long, rough
house on the hillside. The whole party would have
to live in this till better homes could be made for
each family.</p>

<p>"Not long after the big house was done, the captain
of the ship said:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>"'I cannot wait around here any longer. I must
go back to England. Take all your goods from
my ship as quickly as possible.'"</p>

<p>"I should think the Pilgrims would have hated
to see the ship leave," said Joe. "If they got homesick
they couldn't go back to England, no matter
how bad they felt."</p>

<p>"They were not the kind of people to give up,"
replied Uncle Sam. "Before they went on shore
they had a meeting in the cabin of the Mayflower.
They made some good laws for themselves. They
all promised to obey them. Those promises were
very helpful when troubles came.</p>

<p>"And troubles did come, too! The first winter
at Plymouth, which was the name they gave their
new town, seemed to them long and very cold. It
was not really a very hard winter for <i>New</i> England,
but the climate from which they had come was
much milder. In <i>Old</i> England they were not used
to so much cold, snow and ice as they now had, and
they did not know how to protect themselves properly.</p>

<p>"The food was poor and scarce. The one big
house was not made tight enough. The freezing
air, snow and rain came though the many cracks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
One brave Pilgrim after another was seized with
fever or other illness. Before the warm days of
spring came to cheer them one-half of them had
died. Alas! little baby Oceanus was one of these.</p>

<p>"They did not sit still and think over their troubles.
Everyone who was able kept at work. The
men cut down trees in the forest with which to
build houses and a little church. They caught fish
and lobsters. They dug clams.</p>

<p>"The women washed and cooked and spun, and
made everything as homelike as they could for their
husbands and children. The men carried their
muskets with them wherever they went. Miles
Standish had told them:</p>

<p>"'We do not know when the Indians may take us
by surprise. We must be always ready.'</p>

<p>"The very day when the Pilgrims first stepped
on Plymouth Rock they saw Indians peeking at
them from over the hilltop. That was all, however.
In a few minutes the Red Men were out of
sight. It was a long time before any of them
were seen again.</p>

<p>"One day early in the spring the white men were
having a meeting to talk over some plans. Suddenly
an Indian came into their midst. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
painted in the best style of his people. He wore a
bear-skin over his shoulders.</p>

<p>"The men hastily seized their muskets. The
Indian calmly looked from one face to another.
He seemed in no hurry. Then he slowly said:</p>

<p>"'Welcome, welcome, Englishmen!'</p>

<p>"How good those words sounded! All were
filled with wonder and delight. They were puzzled
to think where this savage had learned English
words.</p>

<p>"'Welcome, welcome, Indian.'</p>

<p>"Then they led him to their house and gave him
a good dinner. Samoset, for that was his name,
seemed in no hurry to leave. He stayed hour after
hour. When night came the Pilgrims made up a
warm bed by the side of the fireplace. He slept
there all night, while the white men kept watch.
They were not yet sure whether he meant to be
their true friend. When morning came they gave
him some presents and he went away proud and
happy.</p>

<p>"He soon came back, bringing with him his
friend Squanto and some other Indians.</p>

<p>"Squanto could talk more English than Samoset.
He told the Pilgrims he had seen white men before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
and had lived with them. He had crossed the
great ocean with a white captain who came to
Plymouth with John Smith.</p>

<p>"The white people had treated him kindly and
had afterwards brought him back to his old home.
It was the very place where the Pilgrims were now
living. When Squanto got back he found that his
family had all died of a dreadful sickness. Many
of his tribe had died from it at the same time.
That was why the others had burned their homes
and moved away from Plymouth.</p>

<p>"Squanto was a good friend to the white men.
He came to live with them. He showed them how
to plant corn so it would grow well. He put a
dead fish in each hill to make the ground rich. He
taught them the Indian ways of hunting and fishing.
If it had not been for his kindness and knowledge
the rest of the Pilgrims might have died for want
of food.</p>

<p>"'God has sent us this friend,' thought the good
people of Plymouth.</p>

<p>"Not far away from them lived an Indian chief
named Massasoit. Squanto belonged to his tribe.
'We would like to see Massasoit,' said the chief men
of the Pilgrims. They thought they would be much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
safer from attack if they made peace with the Indian
chief who lived nearest them.</p>

<p>"One day the great chief came to Plymouth. He
liked the white men. Before he went away he
promised to be friendly to them. Massasoit kept
his word and was a good and true friend to the Pilgrims
until he died.</p>

<p>"One time news came to Plymouth that Massasoit
was very sick. Some of his white friends
went to see him. They found him stretched on a
rough bed in his little hut. He had a fever. The
hut was almost filled with Indians. The medicine
men were there. They were making a fearful
noise. They thought an evil spirit had taken hold
of Massasoit. They were trying to drive it away
with the noise. Then the chief would get well.</p>

<p>"The Indians have great faith in their medicine
men. They are their priests, as well as their doctors.</p>

<p>"'That noise is enough to make anyone ill,' said
the white men. 'The air in the hut is heavy and
very bad because there are so many people in it.
Massasoit can never get well at this rate.'</p>

<p>"They got the crowd to leave the wigwam.
Then they gave the sick chief the proper medicine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
for his illness. The fever soon left the chief and he
believed that his white friends had saved his life.</p>

<p>"One day an Indian who did not belong to Massasoit's
tribe came into Plymouth. He brought a
snake-skin filled with arrows and laid it on the
ground.</p>

<p>"'What is the meaning of this?' thought the
chief men.</p>

<p>"'It means war,' said Squanto. 'The Indians
who sent it are not your friends.'</p>

<p>"The arrows were taken out of the snake-skin.
Then it was filled with bullets and sent back to the
unfriendly Indians.</p>

<p>"This said as plainly as any words: 'If you come
to attack us with your arrows, we will shoot you
with our bullets.'</p>

<p>"When the savages saw the bullets they were
afraid. They said, 'Ugh! Ugh!' but they did not
dare to touch them. They at once sent the fearful
things back to Plymouth. They changed their
minds about fighting white people who used firearms."</p>

<p>Uncle Sam stopped and looked around.</p>

<p>"There's nothing like being brave," he said
slowly. "The Pilgrims would not even think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
giving up, and that is why they held out against all
dangers. You remember I told you that only half
of them lived through that first winter. They were
very careful not to let the savages know how many
of them had died. They were even careful not
to make mounds to mark the places where their
friends were buried. They thought the Red Men
might count the mounds. They would know by
that how few of the settlers were left.</p>

<p>"As soon as the spring came, corn was planted
over the graveyard. The tall stalks were soon
waving to and fro, hiding it from sight."</p>

<p>"Now the people were very busy. Gardens were
planted; fish and lobsters were caught in plenty,
and everyone was happy. In the summer wild
berries were to be had for the picking, and the
gardens which had been planted began to yield
nice vegetables.</p>

<p>"Then came the beautiful days of the New England
autumn. The harvests ripened and fields of
corn seemed to cry:</p>

<p>"'Come, gather the golden grain and store it
away for the cold days of winter.'</p>

<p>"Squashes and pumpkins and other good things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
were ready for the picking. Men, women, and
children were busy and joyous.</p>

<p>"When the governor looked on the glad sight,
he said:</p>

<p>"'The Lord has blessed us. We should praise
Him for His mercy to us in this strange land.'</p>

<p>"He set aside a day for prayer and thanksgiving.
Feasts should be spread and all work given
up. His orders were followed.</p>

<p>"That was the first Thanksgiving Day in America.</p>

<p>"What numbers of pies and puddings were made
for that day! What quantities of fish and wild
turkeys were brought by the men and cooked by the
women!</p>

<p>"Thanksgiving morning came at last, and after
a good breakfast everyone went to church. In
those days not even the babies were left at home,
but were carried to church in their mothers' arms.</p>

<p>"There was a long service in the church. A
very long one it must have seemed to the children,
who kept thinking of the great dinner to come soon.
The last hymn was sung, the last prayer made, and
all turned their steps to the tables loaded with good
things to eat and drink.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<p>"The Pilgrims had invited Massasoit and some
of his people to share their feast. The Red Men
were pleased when they received the invitation.</p>

<p>"'We will do our part,' they said.</p>

<p>"They took their bows and arrows and went out
into the forest. They shot some red deer. Early
on Thanksgiving morning they arrived in Plymouth,
bringing the game they had killed.</p>

<p>"When the great dinner was ready at last, one
hundred Indians with hungry stomachs were ready
to share it with the white people.</p>

<p>"It must have been hard to entertain the visitors.
They could speak and understand only a few words
of English. Now and then they would give a deep
grunt to show they were well pleased.</p>

<p>"They stayed not only to dinner, but to supper,
also. Even then they were in no hurry to go
home. Many of them spent the night with their
white friends. They seemed to think Plymouth
was a very pleasant place."</p>

<p>It was quite dark outside before Uncle Sam finished
the story of the first Thanksgiving Day. But
big logs were burning in the fireplace and giving
a soft light all over the room. The old man could
see the children's happy faces. He knew they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
having a good time, though they had kept so quiet.</p>

<p>"I am ready for blind-man's-buff," he said, suddenly
jumping up "I'll be the blind man. Come,
we have been still long enough."</p>

<p>Lamps were quickly lighted. In a minute the
room was filled with the laughter of the Young
folks as Uncle Sam dashed right and left trying
to catch them in his long arms.</p>

<p>"The little Pilgrims though they had a good
time on Thanksgiving Day. But their parents
would no let them make much noise. Dear me!
If children are not allowed to make a noise, they
can't be happy." Uncle Sam was talking to himself
as he walked home after the party.</p>

<p>Just then his big black cat rubbed against his
legs. "Hullo, Buzz, is that you. And did you
think I was speaking to you? Here, smell of this
turkey bone. I brought it home so you could have
a feast, too."</p>

<p>Uncle Sam bent down and rubbed the cat's soft
fur. The he went into the house, leaving Buzz
outside to enjoy his Thanksgiving supper.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="small">LITTLE PILGRIMS OF LONG AGO</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">"Pop</span>! pop! pop!" went the corn as Joe shook
the popper over Uncle Sam's fire.</p>

<p>"It is the very evening for roasted apples and
pop-corn," the old man said soon after his young
friends arrived. "Joe, you run down cellar and get
some of the biggest apples you can find. Lucy,
dear, take these ears of corn and shell them. We
will put the apples in the hot ashes and pop the
corn over those lovely red coals."</p>

<p>"Oh, what fun!" cried Lucy. "You are always
thinking of the nicest things to do. I never knew
anyone like you."</p>

<p>"I hope the Pilgrims had a few Uncle Sams with
them," said Joe, coming back with the apples.</p>

<p>"They popped corn sometimes, but not in our
way," the old man said. "I don't believe anyone
of them ever saw a corn-popper. They used to
hide the kernels in the hot ashes and then watch for
them to come shooting out over the room.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>"Then what fun there was as the children scrambled
to get them! They enjoyed it, and I am glad
they did. Poor little children, they did not have
too much fun at any time. You must not blame
their parents, though. They had been brought up
that way themselves. They thought they must be
very strict or their children might grow up to be
bad men and women.</p>

<p>"'Spare the rod and spoil the child,' they said
over and over again. And they also often repeated
these words: 'Children should be seen and not
heard.'</p>

<p>"Now I believe children should look forward to
Sunday with pleasure," Uncle Sam went on. "It
ought to be the best day in the week for everybody,
young and old. But, dear me! the poor little Pilgrims
had to keep so still and sober from Saturday
evening to Sunday evening, it must have been painful.
Not a loud word must be spoken, not a laugh
must be heard. Then there was the long sermon
Sunday morning. Hours long! Just think of it!</p>

<p>"Rain or shine, heat or cold, everyone went to
church. That is, unless he was too sick to sit up.
They went in a sort of procession. The women and
children walked in the middle. Some of the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
marched ahead and the rest at the end of the line.
They carried their guns, for they must be ready for
an attack by the savages at any moment.</p>

<p>"There was no fire in the church on the coldest
day of winter. Some of the people carried foot-stoves
to keep themselves warm. These were iron
pans or cups in which live coals were carried. The
children sat in one part of the church and their parents
in another."</p>

<p>Joe smiled.</p>

<p>"I know what you are thinking," said Uncle Sam,
who noticed the smile. "You are thinking that the
children could whisper together during the long
sermon. That is a great mistake, Joe. There was
always a man in the church who looked out for such
things. He stood where he could see everything
that was going on. He had a long stick with a
squirrel tail on one end and a hard knob on the
other.</p>

<p>"If he saw one of the older people nodding, softly
and quickly the 'tithing man', as he was called,
would be at the side of the erring one. Then the
furry end of the stick would dance over the sleepy
one's face and the eyes would open with a start.</p>

<p>"But if a child began to whisper, he was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
treated so gently. The hard knob at the other end
of the stick would suddenly come down on his head
and make it ache in a very unpleasant way.</p>

<p>"The Pilgrims had no clocks. They used hour-glasses
instead.</p>

<p>"The tithing-man watched the hour-glass on the
pulpit. The moment the last grain of sand had fallen
through, he walked softly up the aisle and tipped the
glass over.</p>

<p>"The hours in church must have passed very
slowly for the children. The sermon was very, very
long, and they could understand little of what the
minister said.</p>

<p>"The poor children had no Santa Claus. Worse
even than that, they had no Christmas! Thanksgiving
was the only great holiday of the year."</p>

<p>"No Christmas!" cried Joe and Lucy together.</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Sam," Joe went on, "Christmas is
the Christ Day. You know what I mean. And the
Pilgrims thought so much of the Bible and going to
church, and all that! Why, I don't understand."</p>

<p>"They thought it was wrong to make a pleasure
of religious things," replied Uncle Sam. "It was
many, many years before the fashion of the Dutch
people spread over America. It is a grand fashion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
too. Well, well, we cannot help it if the Pilgrims
didn't celebrate Christmas, so we will turn from
that to the brave man whom the children admired
so much.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if they were a little afraid
of Miles Standish. He had a wonderful sword
which he prized above everything else. A Turk had
given it to him. It was marked with strange figures
which the Pilgrims did not understand.</p>

<p>"'That sword will save you from harm so long as
you keep it with you,' the Turk had told the brave
captain.</p>

<p>"Miles Standish was a little man and at first the
Indians made fun of him. They thought he was
too small to be much of a warrior. But they found
they had made a mistake in this and learned to fear
him.</p>

<p>"I think you children have never been to Plymouth.
Next summer I will take you there, if your
mother is willing. You shall stand on the rock
where people say the Pilgrims landed. Then we
will go up to the Memorial Hall and look at Baby
Peregrine's cradle and the chair of the first governor.
Dear me! I can't think of all the things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
saved from those first days of Plymouth. We will
see them all, though, and have a good time."</p>

<p>"That will be jolly fun," said Joe, jumping up
and dancing around the room. "I wish it were next
summer now."</p>

<p>"Don't be noisy Joe," said his sister. "Uncle
Sam won't tell us anything more, if you are."</p>

<p>"I have told more now than you will remember,
my dear," said her old friend. "Before we leave
the Pilgrims, however, I must say one thing. After
they were well settled, friends from England came
to join them. This made them very happy.</p>

<p>"A few years afterwards, still other people came
from England to live in this part of the country.
Their religion was not exactly the same as that of
the Pilgrims. They were called the Puritans.
They said:</p>

<p>"'We do not wish to go out of the English
church. Yet we would like to make it <i>pure</i>. Some
things have grown up in it which we think are
wrong.'</p>

<p>"There were many Puritans in England, but the
king would not listen to them. That is why they
made up their minds to come to America.</p>

<p>"They were not poor like the Pilgrims. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
brought plenty of clothes and furniture, horses,
cattle, and pigs, and everything they needed to make
themselves comfortable. They did not have to suffer
as the Pilgrims did.</p>

<p>"The first Puritans came to Salem. They said:</p>

<p>"'The word Salem means peace. It is a good
name for our new home.'</p>

<p>"Hundreds of Puritans followed the first ones
who came to America. They settled in Boston and
other places near by. They built forts and schoolhouses,
besides homes for themselves.</p>

<p>"They planted wheat and rye as well as Indian
corn. They cut down the forests and caught fish
and salted them. They bought furs from the
Indians, and sent them, as well as lumber and salt
fish, to England. The English people were glad to
buy these things and sent in return books, tools, and
other things the Puritans needed in their new
home."</p>

<p>Uncle Sam stopped to rest a moment. Then he
went on:</p>

<p>"Maybe you think the Pilgrims were strict."</p>

<p>Joe and Lucy nodded their heads.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose they were. We call their ways
old-fashioned, now-a-days. But if you had lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
in their time, you would have been a good deal happier
with them than with the Puritans.</p>

<p>"Strict! Why, the Puritans wanted to <i>make</i>
everybody believe just as they did. They did not
have any patience with those who did not agree with
them.</p>

<p>"They had hard laws, too. They punished anyone
who swore, or even scolded. A high frame called
the stocks stood in the middle of every village. It
had a number of holes in it. Many of those who
did small wrongs had to sit all day with their legs
and arms through these holes. That was the way
they were held up to scorn.</p>

<p>"Then there were ducking-stools. If women became
common scolds, they were bound to these
stools and ducked in a river or pond.</p>

<p>"Once in a while a man was caught swearing.
It was a sad day for him. A split stick was fastened
on his tongue for hours together. If that did
not cure him, his tongue was burned with a red-hot
iron.</p>

<p>"The children had a hard time of it in school as
well as at home. If they told wrong stories, they
had to hold out their tongues to be burnt with a
good dose of mustard."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>Uncle Sam looked quite sad as he went on to tell
of a little girl who took something which belonged
to a playmate.</p>

<p>"Her teacher held her fingers over red-hot coals
and burned them."</p>

<p>"I don't believe children dared to turn round or
whisper in school very often," said Joe.</p>

<p>"I should say not. If they did, a sudden rap
came upon their heads. It made them wish they
had not broken the rules."</p>

<p>"I am glad I am alive now, and have such a lovely
home, and father and mother, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Uncle Sam," said Joe, ending the sentence for
his sister.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="small">ROGER WILLIAMS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> was snowing hard outside and the wind howled
around the little cottage.</p>

<p>Joe and Lucy had been taking supper with Uncle
Sam. Lucy had made a big pile of buttered toast
and her mother had sent over a plum cake. They
were all eaten.</p>

<p>"You must go home pretty soon, children. The
snow is drifting a good deal and it will be hard
walking. It is well that you both wore rubber
boots."</p>

<p>Uncle Sam got up and went to the window.</p>

<p>"It was in just such weather that Roger Williams
made his way through the wilderness," he said as
he looked out over the fields.</p>

<p>"I never heard of him before," said Joe.</p>

<p>"Then it is time you did. It is not a very long
story. I don't believe it will do you any harm to
stay long enough to hear it. So here it is:</p>

<p>"Roger Williams was one of the noblest men who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
lived among the Puritans of long ago. He was
a young minister. He had fine thoughts of his
own. He did not need to have anyone else do his
thinking for him.</p>

<p>"When he first came to America with his young
wife he settled in Boston. He afterwards went to
Salem. He preached in a little church there. He
said so many good things that people liked to hear
him.</p>

<p>"After a while the Puritans began to open their
ears and their eyes, too. The leading men said:</p>

<p>"'This man does not think just as we do. He
must be wrong.'</p>

<p>"They were very angry. You remember what I
told you the other day about the Puritans?"</p>

<p>"They wished everyone else to believe just as
they did," answered Joe.</p>

<p>"And were very strict and solemn," added Lucy.</p>

<p>"You must remember another thing, too. The
leading men of the church made all the laws for the
town. Roger Williams did not think this was
right. He was a minister himself, yet he believed
the church should have nothing to do with governing
the town.</p>

<p>"Besides that, he thought, 'the King of England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
has no right to give the land in America to the
people who come here. The Indians hold the land.
It is theirs. They are the only ones who should
sell it or give it away.'</p>

<p>"'Dreadful! dreadful!' said the people of Salem.
'Roger Williams cannot be true to the king if he
believes like that.'</p>

<p>"The leading men made it so unpleasant for the
young minister that he left Salem. He went to
Plymouth and stayed among the Pilgrims for two
years. At the end of that time he went back to
Salem. He preached good sermons and the people
said:</p>

<p>"'He has grown more careful in the use of his
tongue. He does not say unwise things any more.'</p>

<p>"Yet Roger Williams had not changed his mind.
He believed just as he did before and he could not
help showing it.</p>

<p>"'This man is not safe. He puts wrong thoughts
into the minds of the people,' said some of the leaders.
'We must send him back to England.'</p>

<p>"Roger Williams heard what they intended to do.
He fled into the forests. It was very cold and
heavy snow had fallen. Who would be his friend
and help him in his troubles now?</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p>"Who indeed but his old friend Massasoit! The
Indians loved Williams. He had always been kind
and gentle with them. He had been honest in all
his dealings.</p>

<p>"Massasoit was glad to give Williams a home.
He stayed with the Indian chief for some time.
He was busy thinking what he should do. Where
should he make a home for himself and those who
believed as he did?</p>

<p>"'I will give you some land on the shores of a
river,' Massasoit told him.</p>

<p>"As soon as the spring came Williams went to
this place. He set to work at once to build himself
a log house. Five of his friends came from Salem
to be with him.</p>

<p>"They had not worked very long before they
found they would be safer to move to the other side
of the river. Then they would be sure of a place
where the white men could not trouble them.</p>

<p>"They came to a wild and beautiful spot. The
trees of the forest grew all about it. The river
flowed close by.</p>

<p>"The axes were soon swinging merrily and the
tall trees came falling to the earth. It was the beginning
of the city of Providence.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<p>"Roger Williams gave it that name. He said:
'God has provided a home in the wilderness for
me.'</p>

<p>"Not long after this a little son was born to him.
He, too, was named Providence. And when a baby
daughter came to the happy family, she was called
Mercy. In this way the good minister showed that
he did not forget the loving care of his Heavenly
Father.</p>

<p>"Do not forget Roger Williams," Uncle Sam
ended as the children began to put on their rubber
boots. "He dared to say what he thought was
right when almost everyone was against him.</p>

<p>"Be sure to remember this, too: He had no
trouble with the Indians, because he treated them
fairly. They lived in America before the white
people came, so he thought they had a better right
to the land than anyone else."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="small">THE FATHER OF WATERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">"Look</span>, Uncle Sam! See my lovely new
muff. I wanted one ever so much. My
hands get cold, even in my woolen mittens. Father
bought it for a birthday present. He got home
from Canada to-day."</p>

<p>"What did he bring you, Joe?" Uncle Sam
asked after he had admired Lucy's muff.</p>

<p>"A fur cap. It is a perfect beauty."</p>

<p>"Father says Canada is a great place for hunters,
there are so many wild animals in the forests. He
was dreadfully cold while he was there. He is
glad to be home again."</p>

<p>"Yes, the weather is colder there than it is here,
because it is farther north. Yet the cold did not
keep the Frenchmen from going to live in Canada
long ago. They were willing to suffer a little so
long as they could get rich by hunting and trapping,
and trading with the Indians.</p>

<p>"They were the first white people to settle in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Canada. They called the country 'New France.'</p>

<p>"They built stations here and there along the
shores of the St. Lawrence River. The Indians
used to bring loads of furs to sell to them. The
white men paid for the furs with hatchets, and
beads, and pieces of cloth. That was the kind of
money the Indians liked best.</p>

<p>"The savages of Canada were always friendly to
the Frenchmen. They found that the settlers did
not wish to harm them and that they were treated
fairly. So there was no trouble.</p>

<p>"The Frenchmen loaded ships with the furs they
bought and sent them home to France. They wrote
to their friends in the old country about the gentle
and friendly Indians. Some good French priests
heard the news. They said:</p>

<p>"'We will cross the ocean and go to live among
the Indians. We will teach them about God and
about Christ, the Savior.'"</p>

<p>Uncle Sam was so busy talking, he did not notice
Joe making signs to his sister. These signs said:
"We had better take off our coats and spend the
evening. I know Uncle Sam feels like telling a
story."</p>

    <span class="small">FUR-TRADING WITH THE FRENCH</span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>Lucy understood her brother. In another minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
she and Joe were sitting on either side of the old
man as he began to tell of the good priest Father
Marquette and what he found.</p>

<p>It was a long time ago that Father Marquette
left France and came to Canada. Unlike the fur
traders, he had no wish to get rich. He was a
priest with a kind, loving heart. He cared only to
teach and help the Indians.</p>

<p>As soon as he reached Canada, he asked many
questions about the Red Men. The fur traders told
him of some Indians who lived not far away. They
said:</p>

<p>"These Indians are kind and honest. They will
treat you well."</p>

<p>Marquette went to see them at once. They liked
him because he was gentle and good. They took
him into their homes. He lived with them for three
years.</p>

<p>While he was there, he heard of a wonderful
river. The Indians called it "The Father of
Waters" because it was so long and wide. They
said it was far, very far, to the west of them. Other
Indians had told them about it. They thought it
would not be safe to sail down this river. Tribes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
of fierce savages lived on its shores. They would
kill anyone who came among them.</p>

<p>The good Marquette was not afraid. He only
thought: "These savage Indians have all the more
need of my teaching. I must go to them."</p>

<p>A fur trader named Joliet, and five other men,
went with the priest. They traveled in canoes
made of birch bark. On they went, and still on.
Many days passed by. No Indians were seen as
yet.</p>

<p>At last, they saw huts along the shore. These
must be the homes of the Red Men. In another
minute they heard cries of welcome. The Indians
came hurrying to meet their visitors. They had
heard of the good Marquette from their friends to
the eastward.</p>

<p>They asked him to stay with them. They
begged him to go no farther or he would surely
come to harm. They repeated the stories he had
already heard,&mdash;the stories of fierce Red Men and
of wicked demons which would destroy him. Still
Marquette did not fear. He must not stop yet.
He and Joliet started out once more.</p>

<p>They traveled for many days before they reached
the great Father of Waters. At last it met their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
eyes. How different it was from the river on which
they had been traveling! The waters rushed along,
making a mighty noise. It was a wonder their little
canoe could be kept upright.</p>

<p>The travelers now saw a path leading down to
the shore. It must be an Indian trail. They left
the canoe and followed the trail. They came to an
Indian village. Its people were afraid of the white
men and ran to hide behind the trees.</p>

<p>Some of their chiefs were braver than the others
and came out to meet Marquette. They held out the
pipe of peace to him and his friend. When the
white men had smoked it and handed it back, they
knew there was nothing to fear.</p>

<p>When the good priest asked about the great river,
the Indians told the same old story he had heard
so many times before.</p>

<p>"You must go no farther. There are very bad
Red Men and many frightful monsters to the southward.
They will kill you and eat you if you go
among them."</p>

<p>Marquette and Joliet paid no heed to these words.
Before they went on their journey, however, they
sat down to a great feast which the women had
prepared for them. A dish of mush came first.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
The Indians fed it to the white men with big wooden
spoons. Broiled fish came next, but before it was
offered to the visitors the bones were carefully
taken out. After this a roasted dog was proudly
set before them. It was a great dainty to the Red
Men, but Marquette and Joliet would not taste it.</p>

<p>"It is very queer," thought the Indians. They
could not understand how anyone should refuse to
eat roast dog.</p>

<p>As soon as the feast was over, Marquette asked
the Great Spirit to bless these kind Indians. Then
he bade them good-bye and paddled away in his
canoe.</p>

<p>The river grew wider and wider. Herds of buffaloes
were feeding along its shores. Some of
them stopped feeding long enough to look at the
two white men as they paddled past them.</p>

<p>The daring travelers now came to a place where
high rocks reached up from the banks. Strange
figures were carved on the rocks. They were
painted in fearful colors. They had red eyes and
long beards. They had bodies like fishes. They
were ugly to look at. These must be the monsters
the white men had heard so much about.</p>

<p>They were only pictures of monsters, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
and not real ones. Yet the Indians all along the
river were afraid of them. Whenever the Red Men
had to pass the place, they offered prayers to these
hideous figures.</p>

<p>On went the white men, and still on. The river
was growing wider all the time.</p>

<p>At last they came to a place where the Indians
were savage and unfriendly. The travelers learned
that cruel Spaniards were not far away. After
Ponce de Leon discovered Florida the Spaniards
had claimed that country. They settled there as
well as in other parts of the south. They had some
villages near the lower part of the Mississippi.
Savage Indians and cruel Spaniards together made
the danger too great for the travelers.</p>

<p>"We should only be made prisoners. Then we
could not go back and tell our friends about the
wonderful river." That is what the good priest
said to his friend.</p>

<p>It was too bad, for they were told it would take
only five days more to reach the mouth of the river.
They had made a wonderful voyage already, so they
turned about and started homeward.</p>

<p>Storms and cold weather now troubled them.
They were weak and half sick long before home was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
in sight. The gentle priest was at last too ill to
travel any farther. He stopped with some friendly
Indians while Joliet went on to Canada.</p>

<p>Everyone was filled with delight on hearing
about the great river. "It will belong to France,
because Frenchmen have discovered it," they said.</p>

<p>Cannons were fired and bells were rung in the
city. It was a time of gladness.</p>

<p>Poor Father Marquette was sick for a whole year.
Indeed, he was never entirely well afterwards. He
stayed among his Indian friends and taught them
till he died. They loved him very much and waited
upon the sick priest with the most tender care.</p>

<p>"But this is not the whole story of 'The Father of
Waters,'" said Uncle Sam when he came to the
death of Marquette. "There was another brave
Frenchman who followed in the path of the priest.
I know you will like to hear about him."</p>

<p>The children nodded their heads and Uncle Sam
began</p>


<p class="center in0 p2t p1b">THE STORY OF LA SALLE</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a brave young man
named Robert La Salle. He lived in France. He
was always ready for some new adventure. While
he was still young he thought:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>"I will join my countrymen in Canada and see
something of their strange life among the Indians."</p>

<p>He was soon busy among the fur traders along
the St. Lawrence River and the great lakes. A
piece of land was given to him and he began to
build a fort. He was proud that the French people
held Canada. He wished to do his part in making
it strong so that all enemies could be kept out.</p>

<p>Joliet came back from his long journey. He
told of the great Mississippi River. La Salle was
much excited over the news.</p>

<p>La Salle said, "Our people must not only claim
this river, but we must also build forts and stations
along its shores. Then we can keep off the English
and Spaniards."</p>

<p>His friends in Canada thought La Salle was the
very one to go back to France and tell the king
about Marquette's wonderful trip. He went to his
own country as soon as possible and stood before
his ruler.</p>

<p>He painted a fine word-picture of what could be
done. The Englishmen and Spaniards had been
satisfied to live near the eastern and southern shores
of America. They might not always stay there.
Now was the chance for the French to enter the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
heart of the country and make it their very own.</p>

<p>The king was delighted at what he heard. He
praised La Salle and told the young Frenchman to
go back to Canada and work out his plans.</p>

<p>La Salle lost no time in obeying the king. As
soon as he arrived on the St. Lawrence he went to
one of the lakes and began to build a boat. He
thought:</p>

<p>"Canoes are not strong enough for the great
work before me. I must sail as far as possible
along the chain of great lakes. Then I shall not be
far from 'The Father of Waters'."</p>

<p>He and his men worked hard. It was not long
before the boat was ready to launch. It seemed
very large to the Indians who came to see it start
on its first voyage. Never before had such a large
boat sailed on the lakes.</p>

<p>La Salle had to make his way very carefully, for
he knew nothing about these strange waters. He
sailed through one great lake and passed safely into
the next one. Everything went well. Wherever
La Salle stopped, he met friendly Indians. They
were ready to trust their visitors, for Marquette
had been among them. How good he had been!
How tenderly they had loved him! All other white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
men must be good, too. This was what the Indians
thought.</p>

<p>The vessel soon reached Green Bay, where Marquette
had spent a year among the Red Men.</p>

<p>The Indians had many rich and beautiful furs
which they were ready to sell. La Salle ordered
his men to load the vessel with these furs as quickly
as possible. Then they were to sail back to Canada
and unload them. He and a few others would go
on their way in canoes.</p>

<p>Alas! nothing happened as La Salle had hoped.
A terrible storm arose soon after the vessel started
back. The winds swept over the lake and the little
canoes drifted now one way, and now another.
Every moment it seemed as though people and
boats must be destroyed.</p>

<p>After four days, however, the storm went down
and the men reached the shore. They were faint
from need of food and wet from head to foot. No
Indians were to be seen and they could find nothing
to eat. As soon as they had dried themselves, they
started on again. They hoped to find a village not
far away where they could get food.</p>

<p>The poor tired men paddled on for some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
more but no signs of Red Men nor of their huts
could be seen.</p>

<p>"We will land and look about us," they said at
last. The canoes were hauled up on the shore while
La Salle and his men searched around.</p>

<p>"Here are corn caves!" some one cried in delight.</p>

<p>Sure enough, stores of corn were hidden away
among the rocks. The hungry men helped themselves
to the grain and made their way back to their
camp. They were careful to leave presents near
the caves. They would not think of stealing the
corn. The Red Men must be paid for it.</p>

<p>A fire was soon blazing. The corn was ground
and cooked and they all sat down to eat. Suddenly
they heard a noise and two Indians appeared. The
Red Men held up the beads and cloth that the white
men had left as pay for the corn. They were as
happy over their presents as children are after Santa
Claus has paid them a visit.</p>

<p>It was surely time now for the vessel to return.
La Salle watched for it in vain. It was never heard
of again. It must have been wrecked in the terrible
storm.</p>

<p>After many days of waiting, the men begged to
turn back toward home. They were such a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
company! There were so many dangers around
them, and the ship would never come to their help.</p>

<p>Go back! La Salle could not think of such a
thing. He told his men they should set to work at
once to build a fort. They had little courage, but
they did as he ordered.</p>

<p>As soon as they had finished Fort Break-Heart,
as they called it because they were so sad and discouraged,
a few men were left to hold it. The rest
of the party went on their way into the wild west.</p>

<p>When they came to another good stopping place,
the men built another fort. It was hard work, for
they were sick and lonely.</p>

<p>"It is of no use to go any further now," thought
La Salle. "Ice and snow are around us. The food
is scarce. Nothing can be done till spring comes
again. I will divide our small party into two parts.
Some of the men must stay here to hold the fort.
The rest of us will make our way back to Canada
to get provisions."</p>

<p>It was a hard journey. The lakes and rivers were
caked with ice. The ground was covered with snow.
The brave La Salle and his men suffered from cold
and wet and hunger before they reached a place
where white men were living.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<p>They told their story, got fresh stores, and once
more started off. La Salle did not know the word
"Fail."</p>

<p>Sometimes he and his men paddled along in their
birch canoes. Sometimes they lifted their boats
upon their shoulders and made their way through
the woods.</p>

<p>Danger was around them everywhere. Wild
animals roamed through the forest. Unfriendly
Indians might take them by surprise at any moment.
There were no roads,&mdash;no paths even. One thought
filled the mind of La Salle:</p>

<p>"I must find the Mississippi. I must travel to its
very mouth. That is the only way by which France
can claim all the country on its shores."</p>

<p>When the returning party reached Fort Break-Heart,
they found it torn down. Their friends
were not there. They thought those left to guard
it must have been killed or made prisoners by the
Indians.</p>

<p>It was of no use to stop. They pushed on with
sad hearts.</p>

<p>At last they had their reward. The great Mississippi
lay before them. La Salle's heart was full of
hope as the canoes were launched upon its waters.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>On and on he paddled as Marquette had done before
him. He passed tribes of friendly Indians.
He came to others who were ready to kill the white
men. Still he pushed onward till the waters became
salt and rushed outward to the Gulf of Mexico.
The Frenchmen had at last reached the mouth of
the great river.</p>

<p>Now came the homeward journey and the joy of
telling the good news to the people in Canada.</p>

<p>La Salle did not rest even now. The king of
France must hear what he had done. He made
haste to sail across the ocean to his own country.</p>

<p>The king said that ships must be made ready at
once. A large party of people should go to the
mouth of the river. They must build a fort and
settle there and take the country in the name of
France. La Salle was, of course, chosen to go
with them.</p>

<p>They did not go by the way of Canada. They
went as straight as possible to the Gulf of Mexico.
La Salle thought it would not be hard to find the
mouth of the river.</p>

<p>The voyage across the Atlantic was safely made.
The ships entered the Gulf of Mexico and sailed
along its shores. But La Salle could not find the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
entrance of the Mississippi. He searched long and
carefully. Many times he thought it was in sight.
Many times he was disappointed.</p>

<p>The food became scarce. One of the ships was
wrecked. The men said:</p>

<p>"We had better give up the search and go back to
France."</p>

<p>La Salle was left with a few men on the shore of
Texas. He still had hopes of finding the mouth of
the river.</p>

<p>He wandered about for some time. Even now
he was not willing to give up.</p>

<p>One day a very sad thing happened. The brave
leader, La Salle, was killed. And he was not killed
by the savages, but by one of his own men. They
were angry because he had brought them there.
This was the only reason they had for doing such a
mean and cruel deed.</p>

<p>Such was the end of Robert La Salle.</p>

<p>He did not do all he had hoped to do. Yet he
led the way for other Frenchmen, who afterwards
settled along the banks of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>"The story has a very sad ending," said Lucy,
when Uncle Sam had finished. "I don't like to
have a story stop at such a sad place."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>"I think it is one of the very best you have told
us," said Joe. "I wish I could have been with
La Salle a part of the time. It must have been
exciting, paddling through a strange country and
sleeping at night by the side of a big camp-fire."</p>

<p>"I don't think you would have slept much at
first, with wolves howling and wildcats screeching
not far away," replied Uncle Sam. "Then how
would you have enjoyed going without food for
days together and having your clothes soaked
through in the heavy rains?"</p>

<p>Even this unpleasant picture did not seem to
frighten Joe. He was a "regular boy," as his
mother said.</p>

<p>"If you are going to have adventures, you must
take good and bad things together as they come,"
he said.</p>

<p>Uncle Sam was pleased with the answer.</p>

<p>"That is true, my dear, but remember one thing:
No one should risk his life just for the sake of
adventure alone. Yet, if he is trying to do some
great and useful thing, as La Salle did, and cannot
help meeting dangers, he should be praised for meeting
them bravely and with a stout and trusting
heart."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="small">THE STORY OF A YOUNG QUAKER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">"I</span> am so glad to see you again, Uncle Sam. It
seems as though we had been away a whole
year, yet it is not four weeks."</p>

<p>Lucy talked very fast. Her cheeks were red as
roses and her lips were bright with excitement.</p>

<p>"Only four weeks! Yes, that is all, but it has
been a long time to me," said Uncle Sam, as he bent
down to take Lucy in his arms.</p>

<p>"You don't know how I have missed you children,"
he added. "I have been a lonesome old man
without you."</p>

<p>"We have ever so much to tell you," said Joe,
who had followed Lucy. "You know, this was
our first visit to Philadelphia. We had never seen
our great-aunt before, either. She has lived there
ever since she was a young girl."</p>

<p>"She was so good, we began to love her at once,"
Lucy went on. "She has a soft voice and she
wears a gray dress and a white kerchief around her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
neck all the time. When she spoke to me, she always
said thee or thou instead of you."</p>

<p>"That was because she is a Quaker," Joe broke in.</p>

<p>"I used to know your Aunt Rachel," said Uncle
Sam. "It was a long time ago, though. Now go
on and tell me all about your visit."</p>

<p>The children had never heard that Uncle Sam
had once loved their Aunt Rachel very dearly.
Everyone thought they would be married. Then she
went from home on a visit. While she was away
she met a young Quaker who soon became her
husband.</p>

<p>Perhaps Uncle Sam never got over his love for
the children's aunt. Anyway, he never married.</p>

<p>"There are not very many Quakers in the country
now," said the old man as the children finished
telling him about their visit. "There was a time
when they were glad to come to America. It was
the only way they could have peace. Would you
like to hear about it?"</p>

<p>"Of course, Uncle Sam. We are so tired from
our long journey we can hardly move. Nothing
would be nicer than to sit by your side and listen to
a story," said Joe.</p>

<p>Lucy showed she thought so, too, by pressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
Uncle Sam's hand and looking up at him with a
pleased nod of her little head.</p>

<p>Uncle Sam smiled and began the story of</p>


<p class="center in0 p2t p1b">WILLIAM PENN THE QUAKER</p>

<p>A long time ago there was a rich man who lived
in England. He was an admiral in the English
navy and a great friend of the king.</p>

<p>Admiral Penn had a son named William who was
bright and handsome. The boy had kind parents,
a lovely home, and plenty of money to spend. The
family was a very happy one until William went
away to college. It was then that he first went to a
meeting of the Quakers. He liked what he heard,
and he thought:</p>

<p>"I, too, would like to be a Quaker."</p>

<p>The Quakers believed quite differently from other
people in England. They were like the Pilgrims
in one thing,&mdash;they would not go to the regular
church of the country, but had a different service
among themselves. They thought everyone should
be free to worship God in his own manner. They
were quite different from the Pilgrims in other
ways, however. They thought it was wrong to
fight, even to save their country.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>

<p>"One man should not take up arms against another,"
they said. They believed it was not right
to dress in gay colors. They said it makes people
proud and vain.</p>

<p>They spoke to each other simply, and used the
words thee and thou instead of you, after the manner
of the Bible. They called themselves "Friends,"
not "Quakers." The word "Quaker" was at first
a "nickname," but is what they are now generally
called.</p>

<p>It seems strange that a rich young man, brought
up as was William Penn, should care to join the
Quakers.</p>

<p>He did care, however. He cared so much that
he did not change his mind even when he was driven
from his college because of what he believed.</p>

<p>His father was very angry when he learned that
his loved son had joined with people who were
despised by nearly everyone else. How Penn's
mother must have wept and pleaded with him!</p>

<p>It made no difference, however. The young
man had made up his mind what was right. He
could not change his belief, even to please his parents.</p>

<p>When his father saw that words were of no use,
he told William to leave England and travel about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
in Europe. He gave him plenty of money with
which he could enjoy himself. Admiral Penn
thought his son might forget the Quakers while
visiting other cities and having a good time.</p>

<p>It was not so, however. Soon after William
Penn came home, he was sent to Ireland on business.
While he was there he went to several Quaker
meetings. He was arrested and put in prison because
he was found in these places. It was against
the law for the Friends to hold meetings or to attend
them.</p>

<p>When Penn was free once more, his father sent
for him to come home. He said:</p>

<p>"I will forgive you everything if you will promise
to do three things: Take off your hat to the King,
the King's brother, and to myself, your father."</p>

<p>William Penn said he would think about it. He
could not promise at once, for the Friends did not
think it right to take off one's hat to certain people;
all persons should be treated with the same honor.</p>

<p>After a while the young man came to his father
and said:</p>

<p>"I cannot do as you wish."</p>

<p>His father was so angry that he turned his son
out of doors. Young Penn would have had a sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
time if his mother had not sent him money to keep
him from want.</p>

<p>He began to preach in the streets of the city. He
hoped other people would listen to him and also
become Quakers. It was not long before he was
arrested again. He was put in the Tower of London
for breaking the law. His cell in the Tower
was a dark and dreadful place.</p>

<p>The king's brother was a great friend of William
Penn. He tried hard to have the young man set
free. At last he brought it about.</p>

<p>Penn's father died soon after his son came out of
prison. William was now a rich man. He went
again and again to the king, begging that Quakers
should not be whipped or put in prison.</p>

<p>At last he spoke of money which the king had
owed his father. He said:</p>

<p>"You need not pay this money back to me if you
will give me land in America where the Quakers can
have a free and happy home."</p>

<p>The king was willing to do this, for he owed a
good deal of money and found it hard to pay his
debts.</p>

<p>The poor Quakers were allowed to come out of
prison and seek a home across the ocean. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
called the country that the king had given Penn,
Pennsylvania, which means Penn's woods.</p>

<p>It could have had no better name. The country
was covered with thick woods, and the settlers had
gained it through the kindness of William Penn.</p>

<p>He came to Pennsylvania the year after the first
settlers reached it. He did not try to rule over his
people. He said they should make their own laws.
He told them he wished the new home to be free to
all. It did not matter what a person believed. He
should live in Pennsylvania in peace and happiness.</p>

<p>He helped the Friends to lay out a city which
they called Philadelphia. That meant the city of
Brotherly Love.</p>

<p>They had no trouble with the Indians. Penn sent
word to the near-by tribes that he wished to meet
their chiefs. He said he meant no harm to them.
He would punish anyone who did a wrong to an
Indian. He was willing to pay them for the land
where his people had settled.</p>

<p>One by one the chiefs arrived. They were all
well armed and grand with paint and feathers. They
sat in a half-moon under a large elm tree. Penn
stood in their midst. He had no weapons whatever.
The branches of the tall elm tree waved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
gently overhead while the Quaker talked with the
Red Men and smoked the peace-pipe with them.
He said:</p>

<p>"I will not call you my children, because fathers
sometimes whip their children. I will not call you
brothers, because brothers sometimes quarrel. But
I will call you the same as we say of the white
people,&mdash;Friends."</p>

<p>He told them he and his people would treat them
honestly. They wished for peace always, and
would do nothing to break it.</p>

<p>Before the meeting was over, the Indians promised
to keep that peace and to harm no Quaker.
They gave Penn a belt of wampum. Wampum was
very precious to the Indians. It was made of peculiar
shells. Penn's belt was made of white ones.
It had a picture in the middle made with purple
shells. This picture showed a white man and an
Indian shaking hands.</p>

<p>The Red Men kept their promise. When they
became old and ready to die, they repeated it to
their children, who also promised. Thus the
Friends lived in peace with the Indians, and Pennsylvania
was the happy home of many people.</p>

<p>Penn stayed a long time with his settlers. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
often went to visit the Indians in their villages.
He joined them in their feasts. He played with
their children. The Red Men loved and trusted
him.</p>

<p>When years passed by and the white men in
other places had bloody wars with the Indians, the
Quakers among them were not harmed. The white
feather of peace was placed over the door of every
house where Quakers were living. That was the
Red Man's sign for these words:</p>

<p>"No one here must meet with any harm. The
Red Man is his friend."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="small">LORD BALTIMORE AND THE CATHOLICS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">"There</span> are three churches in our village.
Look, Uncle Sam, we can see the spires of
all of them lighted by the sunset."</p>

<p>"The sun does not have any favorites," was the
reply. "He treats all alike."</p>

<p>"Let me see. One is the Methodist, another the
Congregational, and the third is the Catholic
church," Joe went on.</p>

<p>"They have different names, yet they were all
built for one use,&mdash;the worship of God."</p>

<p>Uncle Sam spoke softly as he looked from Joe
to his sister.</p>

<p>"The <i>name</i> of the church does not matter so
much, so long as people seek it for the right reason,"
he went on. "There was a time when people were
not free to choose their church. You remember
the Pilgrims and the Quakers, and how much
trouble they had.</p>

<p>"Then there were the Catholics. They could not
be happy in England any more than the Pilgrims.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
They heard stories of the great land across the
ocean. They envied the free life of the Pilgrims
and they thought:</p>

<p>"'Why should not we, too, find such a home?'</p>

<p>"Lord Baltimore was one of their leading men.
The king was very fond of him. When he asked
that Catholics might seek a home in America with
him, the king was quite willing. He told Lord
Baltimore they might go with him to Newfoundland.
More than that! Lord Baltimore should rule over
them with as much power as a king. He should
make the laws and punish people who did wrong.
He need not ask the king about anything he wanted
to do.</p>

<p>"'Newfoundland is a beautiful country,' said the
Catholics. 'At least that is what we have been told
by the sea-captains who have been there.'</p>

<p>"One of these captains had visited Newfoundland
in the summer time. He wrote a book about the
place. He told of the berries and roses, the birds,
and the pleasant weather. He did not know that
winters on the island are long and cold.</p>

<p>"Lord Baltimore and his party went to Newfoundland
with hearts full of hope. Alas! at the
end of the first winter they said:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<p>"'We cannot make our home here. We suffer too
much from the cold and bad weather.'</p>

<p>"It is no wonder they felt so. Ten of their people
had died. Many others had been sick. Lord
Baltimore himself was one of these last.</p>

<p>"He wrote a letter to the king telling of his
troubles. He now asked for land in Virginia.
Then he bade good-bye to Newfoundland and sailed
south. He wished to find out if Virginia was as
good a country as he had been told it was.</p>

<p>"He was not disappointed this time. It was all
he had hoped.</p>

<p>"When the people of Virginia heard that Catholics
wished to settle among them, they sent word
to the king of England that they did not like the
plan at all. Then the king said:</p>

<p>"'I will give the land north of Virginia to Lord
Baltimore.'</p>

<p>"When the second party was ready to leave England,
their good friend was dead. His son took his
place as governor.</p>

<p>"'How beautiful this place is!' thought the travelers
as they sailed up the Potomac River after a
long and dangerous voyage.</p>

<p>"'You should call the country I have given you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Maryland, or the Land of Mary,' the king had told
them. This was in honor of the Queen Henrietta
Maria.</p>

<p>"It was because of this that their new home was
called Maryland.</p>

<p>"The party landed first on an island. A large
cross was set up in the ground and the priests gave
thanks to God for bringing them all safely across the
ocean.</p>

<p>"As they sailed up the river, they saw Indians
along the shores. The Red Men did not look kindly
at the strangers. They seemed ready to make war.
The governor thought:</p>

<p>"'This will never do. We must not fight if we
can help it. We must show the savages that we
wish to be friends.'</p>

<p>"He acted so wisely that fear and anger left the
hearts of the savages. They put their bows and
arrows aside and began to help the newcomers.</p>

<p>"One day as some of the settlers were out on an
excursion, a stranger appeared among them. His
skin was so dark, and he was dressed so strangely,
they thought at first that he was an Indian.</p>

<p>"He spoke to them in English, however, and explained
who he was. His name was Captain Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
Fleet. He had been living among the Red Men.
He had once been their prisoner. He gave the
strangers good advice. He said to them:</p>

<p>"'Do not settle on the island where you are now
living. I know another place you would like much
better. It is on the shore of the main land. Some
Indians have a village there. They are kind and
gentle. I think they will be willing to sell their
home to you.'</p>

<p>"It was a good plan. The white people went to
the place and were much pleased with it. It was
in a lovely valley near the shore. Springs of cool
water bubbled up here and there. Groves of nut
and oak trees gave a pleasant shade. No fierce wild
animals roamed through the forest near by. They
must find out at once if the Indians would be willing
to sell such a pleasant home.</p>

<p>"They brought cloth, tools, and beads to the Red
Men. They said:</p>

<p>"'We will give you all these things in return for
your village place.'</p>

<p>"The eyes of the Indians sparkled with delight.
Cloth, tools, and beads were the very things they
most wished for. They were quite ready to move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
away if they could have all these. They said to
the strangers:</p>

<p>"'We will share our village with you till the harvest
is ripe. Then we will gather it and go somewhere
else and leave you here alone.'</p>

<p>"Everyone was pleased and the white people settled
themselves in the huts of the Indians. All
lived together in happiness till the season came to an
end. Then the Indians moved away, but they
showed themselves kind neighbors ever after.</p>

<p>"The white men built houses and planted gardens.
They were more happy and comfortable than they
had ever been before in their lives.</p>

<p>"They went back and forth among their savage
neighbors without fear. Their priests taught the
red children and baptized many of them. One of
the Indian chiefs trusted the white people so much
that he sent his little daughter to live with them.
He said:</p>

<p>"'When I am dead she will rule over my people.
She will be a wiser ruler if she is brought up by the
white men. They will teach her many things she
cannot learn in our village.'</p>

<p>"So it happened one bright morning that the little
Indian maiden left her home in the forest. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
sprang into her light canoe and paddled down the
river. She soon came to the English village.</p>

<p>"The white people were very kind. Yet how
strange their ways must have seemed to her!</p>

<p>"She took off the soft moccasins in which she
could run so easily. She put on leather shoes such
as the English children wore. They must have
seemed very stiff and uncomfortable at first.</p>

<p>"Her dress of beaver-skin and the pretty feather
mantle, of which she was so proud, were laid aside.
She must now wear skirts and waists, like the other
girls around her.</p>

<p>"Now, too, she must spend a large part of each
day in the house, for she had to study lessons in
books. She must also learn to cook and sew and
knit.</p>

<p>"Poor little Indian girl! How different all this
was from her old free life in the forest. Then the
birds and bees, the rabbits and squirrels, were
around her from morning until night. No hat of
any kind kept the soft breezes from blowing through
her hair."</p>

<p>"She must have been very homesick," said Lucy,
when Uncle Sam reached this part of the story. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
shouldn't wonder if she cried herself to sleep every
night."</p>

<p>"It is not Indian fashion to cry," replied Uncle
Sam. "The Red Men are ashamed to let tears
come to their eyes. Even the little children are
taught not to show in their faces what they feel.</p>

<p>"This little girl may have been very unhappy at
first. I really don't know about that. At any
rate, she lived among the white people till she grew
up. Then she married a white man, just as Pocahontas
did."</p>

<p>Uncle Sam stopped for a moment and began to
stroke his chin. That was the sign that he was
thinking.</p>

<p>Lucy began to pet Buzz, who had just waked up
from a nap at her feet. She was thinking, too. It
seemed as though she could see that little Indian
girl of long ago. The child was in a birch canoe
and gliding down the river. Her bright black eyes
were turned longingly toward her home in the forest.
Those eyes seemed to say:</p>

<p>"Good-bye, dear, happy days of freedom. Good-bye."</p>

<p>Joe sat thinking, too. He was wondering if the
Indian girl went back to her people with her white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
husband, and if she was a good ruler after her
father died.</p>

<p>"A penny for your thoughts!" said Uncle Sam
suddenly. He spoke to Joe.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine that Indian princess ruling her
people after the white man's fashion. I do not believe
it would have suited the Indians." The boy
spoke slowly.</p>

<p>"I think you are right, Joe," Uncle Sam answered.
"But I believe she did not have a chance
to try. The Indians were not willing to let a
woman take the old chief's place. They chose his
brother, I believe.</p>

<p>"Now I will tell you what I was thinking of myself.
When I spoke of Pocahontas, I went on to
think of the people of Virginia. You might say
they lived next door to Maryland. They had a
great deal of trouble with the Indians, while their
neighbors in Maryland did not have any.</p>

<p>"The people of Maryland lived in peace and let
others come to settle among them. It did not matter
whether these newcomers were Catholics like
themselves, or Quakers, or Puritans. Anyone who
wished was allowed to live with them and believe
as he liked.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>"The only trouble they did have was with Virginia.
It was about an island in the river. Both
colonies claimed that island. They even had battles
with each other before the trouble was settled.
Maryland was not much to blame, however. Her
people always seemed to wish for peace.</p>

<p>"A happier colony never settled in America than
the Catholics who came to Maryland because of their
kind friend Lord Baltimore."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="small">THE POOR DEBTORS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">"This</span> is the last chance for a story for a long
time and I am sorry," said Joe.</p>

<p>Lucy looked sad too. She was sorry to have
Uncle Sam go away.</p>

<p>"We shall miss the nice stories, but we shall miss
you even more than the stories," she said, putting
her arms around her old friend's neck.</p>

<p>Uncle Sam had been called to New York on business.
He might be gone two months. It might
even be a longer time than that. He could not tell.
He looked from one child to the other with a face
beaming with love.</p>

<p>"One more story. Yes, that is all. Then you
children will have time to think over what I have
told you. And when I come back you will be ready
to hear some more. It is a good thing, after all, for
me to go away and give you a rest.</p>

<p>"You see, children, I get wound up just like a
clock. If I once get to going, I can't stop unless
something makes me."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span></p>

<p>"Give us a rest, indeed!" cried Joe. "Lucy and
I are not babies. We like stories that mean something,
now that we are nine years old. Besides,
you could not tire us anyway, Uncle Sam."</p>

<p>The old man looked pleased.</p>

<p>"Well, well, I am glad to hear it. But it is almost
dark already. I will begin at once with the
story I promised for this evening.</p>

<p>"It is about some poor people in England who
were shut up in prisons. They were not wicked.
They had not stolen nor done any other dreadful
deed. Yet the prison doors were tightly locked
upon them and they were shut out from the beauty
of this great world.</p>

<p>"You shall hear why these people were not free.
They owed money and were not able to pay it back.
In the old days in England there were many poor
people. It was hard to earn a living. Some of
those who tried the hardest, could get no work.
Then, of course, they did not have money. Yet
they needed food and clothing for their families the
same as ever. They could not let them starve.</p>

<p>"It is no wonder they got into debt. If the debt
was not soon paid, they were taken from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
homes. 'Stay in prison till you pay what you owe.'
This was the cruel law."</p>

<p>"But how <i>could</i> they earn any money while they
were in prison?" cried Joe.</p>

<p>"It was impossible, of course. That is why the
law was such a bad one. By and by a very good
man went to visit the prisons. His name was James
Oglethorpe.</p>

<p>"He saw the poor debtors and pitied their sad
case. He wished to help them. He thought of
America. It had already given homes to many
unhappy people. He went to the king of England
and said:</p>

<p>"'Will you let the debtors come out of prison and
go with me to America? They can have a fresh
start and make a new home for themselves there.
You will then have no more trouble with them.'</p>

<p>"The king listened kindly to Oglethorpe's plan.
It seemed a good one. He promised to give land
in America to these people and said that Oglethorpe
should be their governor.</p>

<p>"Not long afterwards, the debtors were set free.
How glad they were to be with their own families
once more! How thankful they must have been to
James Oglethorpe who had done so much for them!</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<p>"When they left England for America, their good
friend went too, so that he might give them his
wise help. Their new home was farther south than
that of any other English people in this country at
that time. It lay next to Florida. The Spaniards
were their neighbors.</p>

<p>"The new colony was given the name of Georgia,
in honor of George, the king of England.</p>

<p>"The first day in the new home was given up to
prayer. All gave thanks to God for bringing them
here in safety. Then came weeks of good hard
work. Houses were built, a wall was made around
the village, and a fort stood ready in case of an
attack by enemies, red or white.</p>

<p>"General Oglethorpe was a wise governor. He
made just laws for his people. He drilled the men
every day in order to make them good soldiers in
case they needed to fight.</p>

<p>"He treated the Indians so kindly they did not
wish to make war upon his people. There was one
chief whose name was Tomachichi. He loved
General Oglethorpe very dearly. One day he
brought a present for the governor. It was the
skin of a buffalo with the feathers of an eagle painted
on it.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>"Tomachichi said: 'The skin of the buffalo is
warm. The feathers of the eagle are soft. These
things therefore mean love and protection. The
English are swift as the eagle and strong as the
buffalo.'</p>

<p>"Tomachichi afterwards visited England with
General Oglethorpe. His wife and nephew went
with him. How strange the crowded streets and
large buildings of London must have seemed to these
savages!</p>

<p>"Soon after Oglethorpe settled in Georgia, he invited
the chiefs of the near-by Indian tribes to meet
together with him. At this meeting he asked them
to keep peace with him and his people. They were
quite willing to do as he asked.</p>

<p>"Then he gave each one of them a fine coat, a hat
trimmed with lace, and a shirt. They must have
felt grand indeed when they put on such elegant
clothes.</p>

<p>"Oglethorpe noticed many mulberry trees growing
in Georgia. He said:</p>

<p>"'Silkworms feed on mulberry leaves. It would
be a good plan for the next ship that comes from
England to bring some silkworms. Then we can
make silk. We can sell it for a good price.'</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>"The silkworms were brought and silk was made.
It was sent over to England and the queen herself
had a dress made of American silk. She wore it
on the king's birthday.</p>

<p>"After a while, however, the people gave up raising
silkworms in Georgia. It did not pay. They
found they could get more money by cutting lumber
in the forests and trading for furs with the Indians.
They sent these things to other countries and were
paid well for them.</p>

<p>"As long as General Oglethorpe was in Georgia
the settlers had two good laws. He would not
allow rum or slaves to be brought into the country.
He was a kind and wise governor in every way.</p>

<p>"And now, children," said Uncle Sam, "don't
you know enough about your country to think the
words of the old song are true? Can you see that
it is really the 'Land of the Free and the home of the
Brave?'"</p>

<p>"Indeed yes, Uncle Sam," cried Joe and Lucy
together.</p>

<p>"There is no country in the wide world like ours,"
added Joe with a positive shake of his head.</p>

<p>"Very well, then. Let's sing 'America' with a
heart and a will," said Uncle Sam. "We can sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
right here on the porch while we sing it. We don't
need the organ to help us out."</p>

<p>The birds had already gone to sleep. But several
of them waked up in the tree-top near by and added
a cheerful chirp to the voices of the three earnest
singers.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
